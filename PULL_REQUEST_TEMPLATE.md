## What is the best way to verify this PR?

it includes tests (and most should), outline here the steps needed to run the
tests. If not, lay out the manual testing procedure and please explain why
tests are unnecessary for this Pull Request. -->

## If this is a bug fix, what versions of Traffic Control are affected?
<!-- If this PR fixes a bug, please list here all of the affected versions - to
the best of your knowledge. It's also pretty helpful to include a commit hash
of where 'master' is at the time this PR is opened (if it affects master),
because what 'master' means will change over time. For example, if this PR
fixes a bug that's present in master (at commit hash '1df853c8'), in v4.0.0,
and in the current 4.0.1 Release candidate (e.g. RC1), then this list would
look like:

- master (1df853c8)
- 4.0.0
- 4.0.1 (RC1)

If you don't know what other versions might have this bug, AND don't know how
to find the commit hash of 'master', then feel free to leave this section
blank (or, preferably, delete it entirely).
