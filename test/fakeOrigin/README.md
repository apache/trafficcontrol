# fakeOrigin

fakeOrigin is a simple HLS video server, capable of simulating live video traffic. It can:

* Serve HLS Live video, by transcoding a static video file as VOD, then manipulating the manifest on the fly to serve an infinitely looping live manifest
* Serve HLS VOD video, from a static video file
* Serve static video and other files

# How to build an rpm
From the root of the trafficcontrol repository use the `pkg` script such as:
```
./pkg -o fakeorigin_build
```
Since this is considered an extra non-required component of the overall functionality of Apache Traffic Control, it's placed in the optional grouping not built by default by `pkg`.

# How to install locally
Local build pre-requesites:
* Go 1.9+
  * OSX: ```brew install go```
  * CentOS: [Instructions]( https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/install-go-1-7-ubuntu-16-04-14-04-centos-7-fedora-24.html)
* FFMPEG 3.4+ (Optional)
  * OSX: ```brew install ffmpeg --with-rtmp-dump```
  * CentOS: [Instructions](https://linuxadmin.io/install-ffmpeg-on-centos-7/)

and/or just a modern version of Docker & docker-compose

If you're building locally, just run ```go install github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/test/fakeOrigin@latest```

If you're just using docker, clone this repository.

# How to use
Running locally:
```
Usage:
fakeOrigin (generates a minimal config.json next to binary)
fakeOrigin -cfg config.json (same as above, but specify the location)
```
Running in docker:
```
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up --force-recreate
... customize the config.json created in ./docker_host (maps to /host inside the container, it's really important to customize this appropriately)
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

On startup it will print any routes that are available after transcoding.  You should just be able to plug those m3u8 url into VLC to start streaming.

I'd *highly* recommend going and reading about the [Configuration](./docs/Configuration.md) to learn about what fakeOrigin can do.

There is also another [set of instructions](build/README.md) if you're interested in building your own RPMs and binaries.
