*********************************
``users/{{ID}}/deliveryservices``
*********************************
.. caution:: This endpoint has several issues related to tenancy and newer :term:`Delivery Service` fields. For these and other reasons, the assigning of :term:`Delivery Services` to users is strongly discouraged.

.. deprecated:: ATCv4
	Use the ``GET`` method of :ref:`to-api-deliveryservices` with the `accessibleTo` parameter instead.

``GET``
=======
Retrieves all :term:`Delivery Services` assigned to the user.

.. [#tenancy] While it is totally possible to assign a :term:`Delivery Service` to a user who's :term:`Tenant` does not have permission to own said :term:`Delivery Service`, users that request this endpoint will only see :term:`Delivery Services` that their :term:`Tenant` has permission to see. This means that there's no real guarantee that the output of this endpoint shows all of the :term:`Delivery Services` assigned to the user requested, even if the user is requesting their own assigned :term:`Delivery Services`.
