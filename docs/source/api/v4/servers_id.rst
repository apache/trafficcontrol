Request Structure
-----------------
.. table:: Request Path Parameters

	+------+---------------------------------------------+
	| Name |                Description                  |
	+======+=============================================+
	|  ID  | The integral, unique identifier of a server |
	+------+---------------------------------------------+

:cachegroupId: An integer that is the :ref:`ID of the Cache Group <cache-group-id>` to which the server shall belong
:cdnId:        The integral, unique identifier of the CDN to which the server shall belong
:domainName:   The domain part of the server's :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`
:hostName:     The (short) hostname of the server
:httpsPort:    An optional port number on which the server listens for incoming HTTPS connections/requests
:iloIpAddress: An optional IPv4 address of the server's :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)` service\ [#ilo]_
:iloIpGateway: An optional IPv4 gateway address of the server's :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)` service\ [#ilo]_
:iloIpNetmask: An optional IPv4 subnet mask of the server's :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)` service\ [#ilo]_
:iloPassword:  An optional string containing the password of the of the server's :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)` service user\ [#ilo]_ - displays as simply ``******`` if the currently logged-in user does not have the 'admin' or 'operations' :abbr:`Role(s) <Role>`
:iloUsername:  An optional string containing the user name for the server's :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)` service\ [#ilo]_
:interfaces:   A set of the network interfaces in use by the server. In most scenarios, only one will be necessary, but it is illegal for this set to be an empty collection.

	:ipAddresses:       A set of objects representing IP Addresses assigned to this network interface. In most scenarios, only one or two (usually one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address) will be necessary, but it is illegal for this set to be an empty collection.

		:address:        The actual IP address, including any mask as a CIDR-notation suffix
		:gateway:        Either the IP address of the network gateway for this address, or ``null`` to signify that no such gateway exists
		:serviceAddress: A boolean that describes whether or not the server's main service is available at this IP address. When this property is ``true``, the IP address is referred to as a "service address". It is illegal for a server to not have at least one service address. It is also illegal for a server to have more than one service address of the same address family (i.e. more than one IPv4 service address and/or more than one IPv6 address). Finally, all service addresses for a server must be contained within one interface - which is therefore sometimes referred to as the "service interface" for the server.

	:maxBandwidth:      The maximum healthy bandwidth allowed for this interface. If bandwidth exceeds this limit, Traffic Monitors will consider the entire server unhealthy - which includes *all* configured network interfaces. If this is ``null``, it has the meaning "no limit". It has no effect if ``monitor`` is not true for this interface.

		.. seealso:: :ref:`health-proto`

	:monitor:           A boolean which describes whether or not this interface should be monitored by Traffic Monitor for statistics and health consideration.
	:mtu:               The :abbr:`MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)` of this interface. If it is ``null``, it may be assumed that the information is either not available or not applicable for this interface. This unsigned integer must not be less than 1280.
	:name:              The name of the interface. No two interfaces of the same server may share a name. It is the same as the network interface's device name on the server, e.g. ``eth0``.
	:routerPortName:    The human-readable name of the router responsible for reaching this server's interface.
	:routerPortName:    The human-readable name of the port used by the router responsible for reaching this server's interface.

:mgmtIpAddress: The IPv4 address of some network interface on the server used for 'management'

	.. deprecated:: 3.0
		This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version. Operators should migrate this data into the ``interfaces`` property of the server.

:mgmtIpGateway: The IPv4 address of a gateway used by some network interface on the server used for 'management'

	.. deprecated:: 3.0
		This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version. Operators should migrate this data into the ``interfaces`` property of the server.

:mgmtIpNetmask: The IPv4 subnet mask used by some network interface on the server used for 'management'

	.. deprecated:: 3.0
		This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future API version. Operators should migrate this data into the ``interfaces`` property of the server.

:physLocationId:  An integral, unique identifier for the physical location where the server resides
:profileNames:    List of :ref:`profile-name` of the :term:`Profiles` that shall be used by this server
:rack:            An optional string indicating "server rack" location
:statusId:        The integral, unique identifier of the status of this server

	.. seealso:: :ref:`health-proto`

:tcpPort: An optional port number on which this server listens for incoming TCP connections

	.. note:: This is typically thought of as synonymous with "HTTP port", as the port specified by ``httpsPort`` may also be used for incoming TCP connections.

:typeId:     The integral, unique identifier of the 'type' of this server
:xmppId:     A system-generated UUID used to generate a server hashId for use in Traffic Router's consistent hashing algorithm. This value is set when a server is created and cannot be changed afterwards.
:xmppPasswd: An optional password used in XMPP communications with the server
