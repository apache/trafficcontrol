		:health.polling.url:                        A URL to request for polling health. Substitutions can be made in a shell-like syntax using the properties of an object from the ``"trafficServers"`` array
		:health.threshold.availableBandwidthInKbps: The total amount of bandwidth that servers using this profile are allowed - across all network interfaces - in Kilobits per second. This is a string and using comparison operators to specify ranges, e.g. ">10" means "more than 10 kbps"

:topologies: A map of :term:`Topology` names to objects

	:nodes: An array of strings which are the names of the EDGE_LOC-type cache groups in the topology

	:cachegroup: The name of the :term:`Cache Group` to which this Traffic Monitor belongs
	:fqdn:       An :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` that resolves to the IPv4 (and/or IPv6) address of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance
	:hostname:   The hostname of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance
	:ip6:        The IPv6 address of this Traffic Monitor - when applicable
	:ip:         The IPv4 address of this Traffic Monitor
	:port:       The port on which this Traffic Monitor listens for incoming connections
	:profile:    A string that is the :ref:`profile-name` of the :term:`Profile` assigned to this Traffic Monitor
	:status:     The status of the server running this Traffic Monitor instance

:trafficServers: An array of objects that represent the :term:`cache servers` being monitored within this CDN

	:cachegroup:       The :term:`Cache Group` to which this :term:`cache server` belongs
	:deliveryServices: An array of objects which contain the XML IDs of the delivery services to which this cache server is assigned (this field is omitted entirely if no delivery services are assigned to this cache server)

		:xmlId: A string which is the XML ID of the delivery service

	:fqdn:             An :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` that resolves to the :term:`cache server`'s IPv4 (or IPv6) address
	:hashId:           The (short) hostname for the :term:`cache server` - named "hashId" for legacy reasons
	:hostName:         The (short) hostname of the :term:`cache server`
	:port:             The port on which the :term:`cache server` listens for incoming connections
	:profile:          A string that is the :ref:`profile-name` of the :term:`Profile` assigned to this :term:`cache server`
	:status:           The status of the :term:`cache server`
	:type:             A string that names the :term:`Type` of the :term:`cache server` - should (ideally) be either ``EDGE`` or ``MID``
	:interfaces:       A set of the network interfaces in use by the server. In most scenarios, only one will be present, but it is illegal for this set to be an empty collection.

		:ipAddresses: A set of objects representing IP Addresses assigned to this network interface. In most scenarios, only one or two (usually one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address) will be present, but it is illegal for this set to be an empty collection.

			:address:        The actual IP address, including any mask as a CIDR-notation suffix
			:gateway:        Either the IP address of the network gateway for this address, or ``null`` to signify that no such gateway exists
			:serviceAddress: A boolean that describes whether or not the server's main service is available at this IP address. When this property is ``true``, the IP address is referred to as a "service address". It is illegal for a server to not have at least one service address. It is also illegal for a server to have more than one service address of the same address family (i.e. more than one IPv4 service address and/or more than one IPv6 address). Finally, all service addresses for a server must be contained within one interface - which is therefore sometimes referred to as the "service interface" for the server.

		:maxBandwidth: The maximum healthy bandwidth allowed for this interface. If bandwidth exceeds this limit, Traffic Monitors will consider the entire server unhealthy - which includes *all* configured network interfaces. If this is ``null``, it has the meaning "no limit". It has no effect if ``monitor`` is not true for this interface.

			.. seealso:: :ref:`health-proto`

		:monitor: A boolean which describes whether or not this interface should be monitored by Traffic Monitor for statistics and health consideration.
		:mtu:     The :abbr:`MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)` of this interface. If it is ``null``, it may be assumed that the information is either not available or not applicable for this interface.
		:name:    The name of the interface. No two interfaces of the same server may share a name. It is the same as the network interface's device name on the server, e.g. ``eth0``.
