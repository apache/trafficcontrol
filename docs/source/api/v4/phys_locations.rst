.. [1] The only "region" key that actually matters in the request body is ``regionId``; ``region`` is not validated and has no effect - particularly not the effect of re-naming the region - beyond changing the name in the API response to this request. Subsequent requests will reveal the true name of the region. Note that if ``region`` is not present in the request body it will be ``null`` in the response, but again further requests will show the true region name.
