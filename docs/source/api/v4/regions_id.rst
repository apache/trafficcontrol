	| Name |                Description                              |

	:caption: Request Example

	PUT /api/4.0/regions/5 HTTP/1.1
	Host: trafficops.infra.ciab.test
	User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
	Accept: */*
	Cookie: mojolicious=...
	Content-Length: 60
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
		"name": "Leeds",
		"division": 3,
		"divisionName": "England"
	}

.. [1] The only "division" key that actually matters in the request body is ``division``; ``divisionName`` is not validated and has no effect - particularly not the effect of re-naming the division - beyond changing the name in the API response to this request. Subsequent requests will reveal the true name of the division. Note that if ``divisionName`` is not present in the request body it will be ``null`` in the response, but again further requests will show the true division name (provided it has been assigned to a division).
