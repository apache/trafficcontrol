:ip6Gateway:     An optional IPv6 address of the gateway used by ``interfaceName``
:ipAddress:      The IPv4 address of ``interfaceName``
:ipIsService:    An optional boolean value which if ``true`` indicates that the IPv4 address will be used for routing content.  Defaults to ``true``.
:ipGateway:      The IPv4 address of the gateway used by ``interfaceName``

	.. seealso:: :ref:`health-proto`

:tcpPort: An optional port number on which this server listens for incoming TCP connections

	.. note:: This is typically thought of as synonymous with "HTTP port", as the port specified by ``httpsPort`` may also be used for incoming TCP connections.

:typeId:     The integral, unique identifier of the 'type' of this server
:updPending: A boolean value which, if ``true``, indicates that the server has updates of some kind pending, typically to be acted upon by Traffic Ops ORT
:xmppId:     A system-generated UUID used to generate a server hashId for use in Traffic Router's consistent hashing algorithm. This value is set when a server is created and cannot be changed afterwards.
:xmppPasswd: An optional password used in XMPP communications with the server
