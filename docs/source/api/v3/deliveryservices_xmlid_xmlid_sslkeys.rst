:businessUnit: An optional field which, if present, contains the business unit entered by the user when generating the SSL certificate\ [1]_
:certificate:  An object containing the actual generated key, certificate, and signature of the SSL keys

	:csr: Base 64-encoded (or not if the ``decode`` query parameter was given and ``true``) csr file for the :term:`Delivery Service` identified by ``deliveryservice``
	:key: Base 64-encoded (or not if the ``decode`` query parameter was given and ``true``) private key for the :term:`Delivery Service` identified by ``deliveryservice``

:state:           An optional field which, if present, contains the state entered by the user when generating certificate\ [1]_
