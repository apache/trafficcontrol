****************
``user/current``
****************

``GET``
=======
.. caution:: As a username is needed to log in, any administrator or application must necessarily know the current username at any given time. Thus it's generally better to use the ``username`` query parameter of a ``GET`` request to :ref:`to-api-v3-users` instead.

Retrieves the details of the authenticated user.

Request Structure
-----------------
:user: The entire request must be inside a top-level "user" key for legacy reasons

	:addressLine1:       The user's address - including street name and number
	:addressLine2:       An additional address field for e.g. apartment number
	:city:               The name of the city wherein the user resides
	:company:            The name of the company for which the user works
	:confirmLocalPasswd: An optional 'confirm' field in a new user's password specification. This has no known effect and in fact *doesn't even need to match* ``localPasswd``
	:country:            The name of the country wherein the user resides
	:email:              The user's email address - cannot be an empty string\ [#notnull]_. The given email is validated (circuitously) by `GitHub user asaskevich's regular expression <https://github.com/asaskevich/govalidator/blob/9a090521c4893a35ca9a228628abf8ba93f63108/patterns.go#L7>`_ . Note that it can't actually distinguish a valid, deliverable, email address but merely ensure the email is in a commonly-found format.
	:fullName:           The user's full name, e.g. "John Quincy Adams"
	:gid:                A legacy field only kept for legacy compatibility reasons that used to contain the UNIX group ID of the user - please don't use this

	:localPasswd:        Optionally, the user's password. This should never be given if it will not be changed. An empty string or ``null`` can be used to explicitly specify no change.
	:phoneNumber:        The user's phone number
	:postalCode:         The user's postal code
	:publicSshKey:       The user's public encryption key used for the SSH protocol
	:role:               The integral, unique identifier of the highest permission :term:`Role` which will be permitted to the user - this cannot be altered from the user's current :term:`Role`\ [#notnull]_
	:stateOrProvince:    The state or province in which the user resides
	:tenantId:           The integral, unique identifier of the :term:`Tenant` to which the new user shall belong\ [#tenancy]_\ [#notnull]_
