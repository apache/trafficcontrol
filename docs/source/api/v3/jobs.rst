``POST``
========
Creates a new :term:`Content Invalidation Job`.

.. caution:: Creating a :term:`Content Invalidation Job` immediately triggers a CDN-wide revalidation update. In the case that the global :term:`Parameter` ``use_reval_pending`` has a value of exactly ``"0"``, this will instead trigger a CDN-wide "Queue Updates". This means that :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs` become active **immediately** at their ``startTime`` - unlike most other configuration changes they do not wait for a :term:`Snapshot` or a "Queue Updates". Furthermore, if the global :term:`Parameter` ``use_reval_pending`` *is* ``"0"``, this will cause all pending configuration changes to propagate to all :term:`cache servers` in the CDN. Take care when using this endpoint.

:Response Type:  Object

Request Structure
-----------------
:deliveryService: This should either be the integral, unique identifier of a :term:`Delivery Service`, or a string containing an :ref:`ds-xmlid`
:startTime: This can be a string in the legacy ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` format, or a string in :rfc:`3339` format, or a string representing a date in the same non-standard format as the ``last_updated`` fields common in other API responses, or finally it can be a number indicating the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970 UTC). This date must be in the future.
:regex: A regular expression that will be used to match the path part of URIs for content stored on :term:`cache servers` that service traffic for the :term:`Delivery Service` identified by ``deliveryService``.
:ttl: Either the number of hours for which the :term:`Content Invalidation Job` should remain active, or a "duration" string, which is a sequence of numbers followed by units. The accepted units are:

	- ``h`` gives a duration in hours
	- ``m`` gives a duration in minutes
	- ``s`` gives a duration in seconds
	- ``ms`` gives a duration in milliseconds
	- ``us`` (or ``Âµs``) gives a duration in microseconds
	- ``ns`` gives a duration in nanoseconds

	These durations can be combined e.g. ``2h45m`` specifies a TTL of two hours and forty-five minutes - however note that durations are always rounded up to the nearest hour so that e.g. ``121m`` becomes three hours. TTLs cannot ever be negative, obviously.

``PUT``
=======
Replaces an existing :term:`Content Invalidation Job` with a new one provided in the request. This method of editing a :term:`Content Invalidation Job` does not prevent the requesting user from changing fields that normally only have one value. Use with care.

.. caution:: Modifying a :term:`Content Invalidation Job` immediately triggers a CDN-wide revalidation update. In the case that the global :term:`Parameter` ``use_reval_pending`` has a value of exactly ``"0"``, this will instead trigger a CDN-wide "Queue Updates". This means that :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs` become active **immediately** at their ``startTime`` - unlike most other configuration changes they do not wait for a :term:`Snapshot` or a "Queue Updates". Furthermore, if the global :term:`Parameter` ``use_reval_pending`` *is* ``"0"``, this will cause all pending configuration changes to propagate to all :term:`cache servers` in the CDN.

:assetUrl: A regular expression - matching URLs will be operated upon according to ``keyword``

	.. note:: Unlike in the payloads of POST_ requests to this endpoint, this must be a **full** URL regular expression, as it is **not** combined with the :ref:`ds-origin-url` of the :term:`Delivery Service` identified by ``deliveryService``.

:createdBy:       The username of the user who initiated the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`\ [#readonly]_
:deliveryService: The :ref:`ds-xmlid` of the :term:`Delivery Service` on which this :term:`Content Invalidation Job` operates\ [#readonly]_ - unlike POST_ request payloads, this cannot be an integral, unique identifier
:id:              An integral, unique identifier for this :term:`Content Invalidation Job`\ [#readonly]_
:keyword:         A keyword that represents the operation being performed by the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`. It can have any (string) value, but the only value with any meaning to Traffic Control is:

	PURGE
		This :term:`Content Invalidation Job` will prevent caching of URLs matching the ``assetUrl`` until it is removed (or its Time to Live expires)

:parameters: A string containing space-separated key/value pairs - delimited by colons (:kbd:`:`\ s) representing parameters associated with the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`. In practice, any string can be passed as a :term:`Content Invalidation Job`'s ``parameters``, but the only value with meaning is a single key/value pair indicated a :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` in hours in the format :file:`TTL:{hours}h`, and any other type of value may cause components of Traffic Control to work improperly or not at all.
:startTime:  This can be a string in the legacy ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` format, or a string in :rfc:`3339` format, or a string representing a date in the same non-standard format as the ``last_updated`` fields common in other API responses, or finally it can be a number indicating the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970 UTC). This **must** be in the future, but only by no more than two days.

``DELETE``
==========
Deletes a :term:`Content Invalidation Job`.

.. tip:: Content :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs` that have passed their :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` are not automatically deleted - for record-keeping purposes - so use this to clean up old :term:`jobs` that are no longer useful.

.. caution:: Deleting a :term:`Content Invalidation Job` immediately triggers a CDN-wide revalidation update. In the case that the global :term:`Parameter` ``use_reval_pending`` has a value of exactly ``"0"``, this will instead trigger a CDN-wide "Queue Updates".

.. [#tenancy] When viewing :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs`, only those :term:`jobs` that operate on a :term:`Delivery Service` visible to the requesting user's :term:`Tenant` will be returned. Likewise, creating a new :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs` requires that the target :term:`Delivery Service` is modifiable by the requesting user's :term:`Tenant`. However, when modifying or deleting an existing :term:`Content Invalidation Jobs`, the operation can be completed if and only if the requesting user's :term:`Tenant` is the same as the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`'s :term:`Delivery Service`'s :term:`Tenant` or a descendant thereof, **and** if the requesting user's :term:`Tenant` is the same as the :term:`Tenant` of the *user who initially created the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`* or a descendant thereof.
.. [#readonly] This field must exist, but it must *not* be different than the same field of the existing :term:`Content Invalidation Job` (i.e. as seen in a GET_ response)
