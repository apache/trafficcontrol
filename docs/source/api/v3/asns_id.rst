***************
``asns/{{id}}``
***************
.. seealso:: `The Autonomous System Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29>`_ for an explanation of what an :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` actually is.

``PUT``
=======
Allows user to edit an existing :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)`-to-:term:`Cache Group` association.

:Auth. Required: Yes
:Roles Required: "admin" or "operations"
:Response Type: Object

Request Structure
-----------------
:asn:          The new :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` which will be associated with the identified :term:`Cache Group` - must not conflict with existing associations
:cachegroup: An optional field which, if present, is a string that specifies the :ref:`cache-group-name` of a :term:`Cache Group` to which this :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` will be assigned

	.. note:: While this endpoint accepts the ``cachegroup`` field, sending this in the request payload has no effect except that the response will (erroneously) name the :term:`Cache Group` to which the :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` was assigned. Any subsequent requests will reveal that, in fact, the :term:`Cache Group` is set entirely by the ``cachegroupId`` field, and so the actual :ref:`cache-group-name` may differ from what was in the request.

:cachegroupId: An integer that is the :ref:`cache-group-id` of a :term:`Cache Group` to which this :abbr:`ASN (Autonomous System Number)` will be assigned - must not conflict with existing associations
