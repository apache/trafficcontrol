``PUT``
=======
Allows users to edit an existing :term:`Delivery Service`.

:Auth. Required: Yes
:Roles Required: "admin" or "operations"\ [#tenancy]_
:Response Type:  **NOT PRESENT** - Despite returning a ``200 OK`` response (rather than e.g. a ``204 NO CONTENT`` response), this endpoint does **not** return a representation of the modified resource in its payload, and instead returns nothing - not even a success message.

.. [#tenancy] Only those :term:`Delivery Services` assigned to :term:`Tenants` that are the requesting user's :term:`Tenant` or children thereof will appear in the output of a ``GET`` request, and the same constraints are placed on the allowed values of the ``tenantId`` field of a ``PUT`` request to update a new :term:`Delivery Service`. Furthermore, the only :term:`Delivery Services` a user may delete are those assigned to a :term:`Tenant` that is either the same :term:`Tenant` as the user's :term:`Tenant`, or a descendant thereof.
.. [#geoLimit] These fields must be defined if and only if ``geoLimit`` is non-zero
