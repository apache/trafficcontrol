Traffic Ops
***********
Traffic Ops is quite possibly the single most complex and most important Traffic Control component. It has many different configuration options that affect a wide range of other components and their interactions.

.. _to-install:

Installing
==========

System Requirements
-------------------
The user must have the following for a successful minimal install:

- CentOS 7 or later
- Two machines - physical or virtual -, each with at least two (v)CPUs, 4GB of RAM, and 20 GB of disk space
- Access to CentOS Base and EPEL :manpage:`yum(8)` repositories
- Access to `The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) <http://www.cpan.org/>`_

Guide
-----
#. Install PostgreSQL Database. For a production install it is best to install PostgreSQL on its own server/virtual machine.

	.. seealso:: For more information on installing PostgreSQL, see `their documentation <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/>`_.

	.. code-block:: shell
		:caption: Example PostgreSQL Install Procedure

		yum update -y
		yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
		yum install -y postgresql13-server
		su - postgres -c '/usr/pgsql-13/bin/initdb -A md5 -W' #-W forces the user to provide a superuser (postgres) password


#. Edit :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf` to allow the Traffic Ops instance to access the PostgreSQL server. For example, if the IP address of the machine to be used as the Traffic Ops host is ``192.0.2.1`` add the line ``host  all   all     192.0.2.1/32 md5`` to the appropriate section of this file.

#. Edit the :file:`/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/postgresql.conf` file to add the appropriate listen_addresses or ``listen_addresses = '*'``, set ``timezone = 'UTC'``, and start the database

	.. code-block:: shell
		:caption: Starting PostgreSQL with :manpage:`systemd(1)`

		systemctl enable postgresql-13
		systemctl start postgresql-13
		systemctl status postgresql-13 # Prints the status of the PostgreSQL service, to prove it's running


#. Build a :file:`traffic_ops-{version string}.rpm` file using the instructions under the :ref:`dev-building` page - or download a pre-built release from `the Apache Continuous Integration server <https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/TrafficControl/>`_.

#. Install a PostgreSQL client on the Traffic Ops host

	.. code-block:: shell
		:caption: Installing PostgreSQL Client from a Hosted Source

		yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-7-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

#. Install the Traffic Ops RPM. The Traffic Ops RPM file should have been built in an earlier step.

	.. code-block:: shell
		:caption: Installing a Generated Traffic Ops RPM

		yum install -y ./dist/traffic_ops-3.0.0-xxxx.yyyyyyy.el7.x86_64.rpm

	.. note:: This will install the PostgreSQL client, ``psql`` as a dependency.

#. Login to the Database from the Traffic Ops machine. At this point you should be able to login from the Traffic Ops (hostname ``to`` in the example) host to the PostgreSQL (hostname ``pg`` in the example) host

	.. code-block:: psql
		:caption: Example Login to Traffic Ops Database from Traffic Ops Server

		to-# psql -h pg -U postgres
		Password for user postgres:
		psql (13.2)
		Type "help" for help.

		postgres=#


#. Create the user and database. By default, Traffic Ops will expect to connect as the ``traffic_ops`` user to the ``traffic_ops`` database.

	.. code-block:: console
		:caption: Creating the Traffic Ops User and Database

		to-# psql -U postgres -h pg -c "CREATE USER traffic_ops WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'tcr0cks';"
		Password for user postgres:
		CREATE ROLE
		to-# createdb traffic_ops --owner traffic_ops -U postgres -h pg
		Password:
		to-#

#. Now, run the following command as the root user (or with :manpage:`sudo(8)`): :file:`/opt/traffic_ops/install/bin/postinstall`. Some additional files will be installed, and then it will proceed with the next phase of the install, where it will ask you about the local environment for your CDN. Please make sure you remember all your answers and verify that the database answers match the information previously used to create the database.

The postinstall script can also be run non-interactively using :atc-file:`traffic_ops/install/bin/input.json`. To use it, first change the values to match your environment, then pass it to the ``postinstall`` script:
	.. code-block:: console
		:caption: Postinstall in Automatic (-a) mode

		/opt/traffic_ops/install/bin/postinstall -a --cfile /opt/traffic_ops/install/bin/input.json

.. versionchanged:: ATCv8
	The values in ``input.json`` for the ``"hidden"`` properties have been changed from ``"1"`` and ``"0"`` to ``true`` and ``false``.

.. versionchanged:: ATCv8
	Python 2.x is no longer supported by the ``postinstall`` script.

.. versionremoved:: ATCv8
	In earlier versions of ATC, it was possible to run ``postinstall`` using Perl - no longer.

.. _to-upgrading:

Upgrading
=========
To upgrade from older Traffic Ops versions, stop the service, use :manpage:`yum(8)` to upgrade to the latest available Traffic Ops package, and use the :ref:`admin <database-management>` tool to perform the database upgrade.

.. tip:: In order to upgrade to the latest version of Traffic Ops, please be sure that you have first upgraded to the latest available minor or patch version of your current release. For example, if your current Traffic Ops version is 3.0.0 and version 3.1.0 is available, you must first upgrade to 3.1.0 before proceeding to upgrade to 4.0.0. (Specifically, this means running all migrations, :atc-file:`traffic_ops/app/db/seeds.sql`, and :file:`traffic_ops/app/db/patches.sql` for the latest of your current major version - which should be handled by the :program:`admin` tool). The latest migration available before the release of 4.0.0 (pending at the time of this writing) was :file:`traffic_ops/app/db/migrations/20180814000625_remove_capabilities_for_reseed.sql`, so be sure that migrations up to this point have been run before attempting to upgrade Traffic Ops.

.. seealso:: :ref:`database-management` for more details about :program:`admin`.

.. code-block:: shell
	:caption: Sample Script for Upgrading Traffic Ops

	systemctl stop traffic_ops
	yum upgrade traffic_ops
	pushd /opt/traffic_ops/app/
	./db/admin --env production upgrade
	./db/admin --env production --trafficvault upgrade
	popd

After this completes, see Guide_ for instructions on running the :program:`postinstall` script. Once the :program:`postinstall` script, has finished, run the following command as the root user (or with :manpage:`sudo(8)`): ``systemctl start traffic_ops`` to start the service.

Upgrading to 6.0
----------------

As of Apache Traffic Control 6.0, Traffic Ops supports PostgreSQL version 13.2. In order to migrate from the prior PostgreSQL version 9.6, it is recommended to use the `pg_upgrade <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/pgupgrade.html>`_ tool.

.. _to-running:

Running
=======
While this section contains instructions for running Traffic Ops manually, the only truly supported method is via :manpage:`systemd(8)`, e.g. :bash:`systemctl start traffic_ops` (this method starts the program properly and uses its default configuration file locations).

.. program:: traffic_ops

traffic_ops_golang
------------------
``traffic_ops_golang [--version] [--plugins] [--api-routes] --cfg CONFIG_PATH --dbcfg DB_CONFIG_PATH [--riakcfg RIAK_CONFIG_PATH] [--backendcfg BACKEND_CONFIG_PATH]``

.. option:: --cfg CONFIG_PATH

	This **mandatory** command line flag specifies the absolute or relative path to the configuration file to be used by Traffic Ops - `cdn.conf`_.

.. option:: --dbcfg DB_CONFIG_PATH

	This **mandatory** command line flag specifies the absolute or relative path to a configuration file used by Traffic Ops to establish connections to the PostgreSQL database - `database.conf`_

.. option:: --plugins

	List the installed plugins and exit.

.. option:: --api-routes

	Print information about all API routes and exit. If also used with the :option:`--cfg` option, also print out the configured routing blacklist information from `cdn.conf`_.

.. option:: --riakcfg RIAK_CONFIG_PATH

	.. deprecated:: 6.0
		This optional command line flag specifies the absolute or relative path to a configuration file used by Traffic Ops to establish connections to Riak when used as the Traffic Vault backend - `riak.conf`_. Please use ``"traffic_vault_backend": "riak"`` and ``"traffic_vault_config": {...}`` (with the contents of `riak.conf`_) instead.

	.. impl-detail:: The name of this flag is derived from the current database used in the implementation of Traffic Vault - `Riak KV <https://riak.com/products/riak-kv/index.html>`_.

.. option:: --backendcfg BACKEND_CONFIG_PATH

	This optional command line flag specifies the absolute or relative path to a configuration file used by Traffic Ops to act as a reverse proxy and forward requests on the specified paths to the corresponding hosts - `backends.conf`_

.. option:: --version

	Print version information and exit.

Configuring
===========
:program:`traffic_ops_golang` uses several configuration files, but the most important of these is `cdn.conf`_.

Configuration Files
-------------------

.. _cdn.conf:

cdn.conf
""""""""
This file deals with the configuration parameters of running Traffic Ops itself. It is a JSON-format set of options and their respective values. `traffic_ops_golang`_ will use whatever file is specified by its :option:`--cfg` option. The keys of the file are described below.

:acme_accounts: This is an optional array of objects to define ref:`external_account_binding` information to an existing :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` account.  The `acme_provider` and `user_email` combination must be unique.

	.. versionadded:: 5.1

	:acme_provider: The certificate provider. This field needs to correlate to the AuthType field for each certificate so the renewal functionality knows which provider to use.
	:user_email:    The email used to set up the account with the provider.
	:acme_url:      The URL for the :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)`.
	:kid:           The key ID provided by the :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider for ref:`external_account_binding`.
	:hmac_encoded:  The :abbr:`HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code)` key provided by the :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider for ref:`external_account_binding`. This should be in Base64 URL encoded.

:acme_renewal: This object contains the information for the automatic renewal script for certificates.

	.. versionadded:: 5.1

	:renew_days_before_expiration: Set the number of days before expiration date to renew certificates.
	:summary_email: The email address to use for summarizing certificate expiration and renewal status. If it is blank, no email will be sent.

:client_certificate_authentication: This is an optional section of configurations client provided certificate based authentication. However, if ``"ClientAuth" : "1"``` is enabled in the ``tls_config`` section in ``traffic_ops_golang``, then this field is required.

	.. versionadded:: 7.0

	:root_certificates_directory: A string representing the absolute path of the directory where Root CA certificates are located. These Root CA certificates are used for verifying the certificate provided by the client.

:default_certificate_info: This is an optional object to define default values when generating a self signed certificate when an HTTPS delivery service is created or updated. If this is an empty object or not present in the :ref:`cdn.conf` then the term "Placeholder" will be used for all fields.

	:business_unit: An optional field which, if present, will represent the business unit for which the SSL certificate was generated
	:city: An optional field which, if present, will represent the resident city of the generated SSL certificate
	:organization: An optional field which, if present, will represent the organization for which the SSL certificate was generated
	:country: An optional field which, if present, will represent the resident country of the generated SSL certificate
	:state: An optional field which, if present, will represent the resident state or province of the generated SSL certificate

:geniso: This object contains configuration options for system ISO generation.

	:iso_root_path: Sets the filesystem path to the root of the ISO generation directory. For default installations, this should usually be set to :file:`/opt/traffic_ops/app/public`.

	.. deprecated:: ATCv6
		The ``geniso.iso_root_path`` configuration option is unused now that Traffic Ops is rewritten from Perl to Golang and will be removed in a future ATC release.

	.. seealso:: :ref:`tp-tools-generate-iso`

:inactivity_timeout: Serves no known purpose anymore.
:influxdb_conf_path: An optional field which gives `traffic_ops_golang`_ the absolute or relative path to an `influxdb.conf`_ file. Default if not specified is to first check if the :envvar:`MOJO_MODE` environment variable is set. If it is, then Traffic Ops will look in the current working directory for a subdirectory named ``conf/``, then inside that for a subdirectory with the name that is the value of the :envvar:`MOJO_MODE` variable, and inside that directory for a file named ``influxdb.conf``. If :envvar:`MOJO_MODE` is *not* set, then Traffic Ops will look for a file named ``influxdb.conf`` in the same directory as this ``cdn.conf`` file.

	.. versionadded:: 4.0

	.. warning:: While relative paths are allowed, they are discouraged, as the path will be relative to the working directory of the `traffic_ops_golang`_ process itself, not relative to the ``cdn.conf`` configuration file, which can be confusing.

:ldap_conf_location: An optional field which gives `traffic_ops_golang`_ the absolute or relative path to an `ldap.conf`_ file. Default if not specified is a file named ``ldap.conf`` in the same directory as this ``cdn.conf`` file.

	.. warning:: While relative paths are allowed, they are discouraged, as the path will be relative to the working directory of the `traffic_ops_golang`_ process itself, not relative to the ``cdn.conf`` configuration file, which can be confusing.

:lets_encrypt:

	.. versionadded:: 4.1

	:user_email: A required email address to create an account with Let's Encrypt or to receive expiration updates. If this is not included then `rate limits <https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits>`_ may apply for the number of certificates.
	:send_expiration_email: A boolean option to send email summarizing certificate expiration status

		.. deprecated:: 5.1
			Future versions of Traffic Ops will not support this legacy configuration option, see acme_renewal: { summary_email: <string> } instead.

	:convert_self_signed: A boolean option to convert self signed to Let's Encrypt certificates as they expire. This only works for certificates labeled as Self Signed in the Certificate Source field.
	:renew_days_before_expiration: Set the number of days before expiration date to renew certificates.

		.. deprecated:: 5.1
			Future versions of Traffic Ops will not support this legacy configuration option, see acme_renewal: { renew_days_before_expiration: <int> } instead.

	:environment: This specifies which Let's Encrypt environment to use: 'staging' or 'production'. It defaults to 'production'.

:portal: This section provides information regarding a connected UI with which users interact, so that emails can include links to it.

	:base_url: This URL should be the root and/or landing page of the UI. For Traffic Portal instances, this should include the fragment part of the URL, e.g. ``https://trafficportal.infra.ciab.test/#!/``.
	:docs_url: The actual use of this URL is unknown, but supposedly it ought to point to the documentation for the Traffic Control instance. It's hard to imagine a fantastic reason this shouldn't just always be https://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io
	:email_from: Most emails sent from the Traffic Ops server will use ``to.email_from``, but specifically password reset requests (which contain a link to a fragment under ``portal.base_url``) will instead use this as the value of their :mailheader:`From` field.
	:pass_reset_path: A path to be added to ``base_url`` that is the URL of the UI's password reset interface. For Traffic Portal instances, this should always be set to "user".
	:user_register_path: A path to be added to ``base_url`` that is the URL of the UI's new user registration interface. For Traffic Portal instances, this should always be set to "user".

:secrets: This is an array of strings, which cannot be empty. The first secret in the array is used to encrypt Traffic Ops authentication cookies - multiple Traffic Ops instances serving the same CDN need to share secrets in order for users logged into one to be able to use their cookie as authentication with other instances.
:smtp:    This optional section contains options for connecting to and authenticating with an :abbr:`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` server for sending emails. If this section is undefined (or if ``enabled`` is explicitly ``false``), Traffic Ops will not be able to send emails and certain :ref:`to-api` endpoints that depend on that functionality will fail to operate.

	.. versionadded:: 4.0

	:address:  This is the address of the :abbr:`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` which will be used to send emails. Should include the port number, e.g. ``"localhost:25"`` for :manpage:`sendmail(8)` on the Traffic Ops server.
	:enabled:  A boolean flag that determines whether or not connection to an :abbr:`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` ought to be allowed. Whatever the settings of the other fields in the ``smtp`` object, email cannot and will not be sent if this is ``false``.
	:password: The password to be used when authenticating with the :abbr:`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` server.
	:user:     The name of the user to be used when authenticating with the :abbr:`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` server.

	.. Note:: The SMTP integration currently only supports Login Auth.

:to: Contains information to identify Traffic Ops in a network sense.

	:base_url:             This field is used to identify the location for the now-removed Traffic Ops UI. It no longer serves any purpose.
	:email_from:           Sets the address that will appear in the :mailheader:`From` field of Emails sent by Traffic Ops.
	:no_account_found_msg: When a password reset is requested for an email address not registered to any known user, this is the message that will be sent to that email address.

:traffic_ops_golang: This group configuration options is used exclusively by `traffic_ops_golang`_.

	:cert: The "cert" field sets the location of the SSL certificate to use for encrypting connections.
	:crconfig_emulate_old_path: An optional boolean that controls the value of a part of :term:`Snapshots` that report what :ref:`to-api` endpoint is used to generate :term:`Snapshots`. If this is ``true``, it forces Traffic Ops to report that a legacy, deprecated endpoint is used, whereas if it's ``false`` Traffic Ops will report the actual, current endpoint. Default if not specified is ``false``.

		.. deprecated:: 3.0
			Future versions of Traffic Ops will not support this legacy configuration option, and will always report the current endpoint.

	:crconfig_snapshot_use_client_request_host: An optional boolean which controls the value of the Traffic Ops server's URL as inserted into :term:`Snapshots`. If this is ``true``, then the value used will be taken from the :mailheader:`Host` header of the request that generated the :term:`Snapshot`. If it's ``false``, then it will instead use the value of the global "tm.url" :term:`Parameter`. Default if not specified is ``false``.

		.. deprecated:: 3.0
			Future versions of Traffic Ops will not support this legacy configuration option, and will always use the global "tm.url" :term:`Parameter`.

	:db_conn_max_lifetime_seconds: An optional field that sets the maximum lifetime in seconds of any given connection to the Traffic Ops Database. If set to zero, connections are held open until explicitly closed. Default if not specified is the value of :atc-godoc:`traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/config.DBConnMaxLifetimeSecondsDefault`.
	:db_max_idle_connections: An optional limit on the number of connections to the Traffic Ops Database to keep alive while idle. If this is less than ``max_db_connections``, that number will be used instead - *even if this field is unset and using its default*. Default if not specified is the value of :atc-godoc:`traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/config.DBMaxIdleConnectionsDefault`.
	:db_query_timeout_seconds: An optional field specifying a timeout on database *transactions* (not actually single queries in most cases) within API route handlers. Effectively this is a timeout on a single handler's ability to interact with the Traffic Ops Database. Default if not specified is the value of :atc-godoc:`traffic_ops/traffic_ops_golang/config.DefaultDBQueryTimeoutSecs`.
	:idle_timeout: An optional timeout in seconds for idle client connections to Traffic Ops. If set to zero, the value of ``read_timeout`` will be used instead. If both are zero, then the value of ``read_header_timeout`` will be used. If all three fields are zero, there is no timeout and connections will be kept alive indefinitely - **not** recommended. Default if not specified is zero.
	:insecure: An optional boolean which, if set to ``true`` will cause Traffic Ops to skip verification of client certificates whenever necessary/possible. If set to ``false``, the normal verification behavior is exhibited. Default if not specified is ``false``.

		.. deprecated:: 5.0
			Future versions of Traffic Ops will not support this legacy configuration option, see tls_config: { InsecureSkipVerify: <bool> } instead

	:key: The "key" field is the certificate's corresponding private key.
	:log_location_debug: This optional field, if specified, should either be the location of a file to which debug-level output will be logged, or one of the special strings ``"stdout"`` which indicates that STDOUT should be used, ``"stderr"`` which indicates that STDERR should be used or ``"null"`` which indicates that no output of this level should be generated. An empty string (``""``) and literally ``null`` are equivalent to ``"null"``. Default if not specified is ``"null"``.
	:log_location_error: This optional field, if specified, should either be the location of a file to which error-level output will be logged, or one of the special strings ``"stdout"`` which indicates that STDOUT should be used, ``"stderr"`` which indicates that STDERR should be used or ``"null"`` which indicates that no output of this level should be generated. An empty string (``""``) and literally ``null`` are equivalent to ``"null"``. Default if not specified is ``"null"``. This field is also used to determine where server profiling statistics are written. Assuming ``profiling_enabled`` is ``true`` and ``profiling_location`` is unset, if this field's value is given as a path to a regular file, a file named :file:`profiling` will be written to the same directory containing the profiling information - overwriting any existing files by that name.
	:log_location_event: This optional field, if specified, should either be the location of a file to which event-level output will be logged, or one of the special strings ``"stdout"`` which indicates that STDOUT should be used, ``"stderr"`` which indicates that STDERR should be used or ``"null"`` which indicates that no output of this level should be generated. An empty string (``""``) and literally ``null`` are equivalent to ``"null"``. Default if not specified is ``"null"``.
	:log_location_info: This optional field, if specified, should either be the location of a file to which informational-level output will be logged, or one of the special strings ``"stdout"`` which indicates that STDOUT should be used, ``"stderr"`` which indicates that STDERR should be used or ``"null"`` which indicates that no output of this level should be generated. An empty string (``""``) and literally ``null`` are equivalent to ``"null"``. Default if not specified is ``"null"``.
	:log_location_warning: This optional field, if specified, should either be the location of a file to which warning-level output will be logged, or one of the special strings ``"stdout"`` which indicates that STDOUT should be used, ``"stderr"`` which indicates that STDERR should be used or ``"null"`` which indicates that no output of this level should be generated. An empty string (``""``) and literally ``null`` are equivalent to ``"null"``. Default if not specified is ``"null"``.
	:max_db_connections: An optional limit on the number of allowed concurrent connections to the Traffic Ops Database. If it is less than or equal to zero, there is no limit. Default if not specified is zero.
	:oauth_client_secret: An optional secret string to be shared with OAuth-capable clients attempting to authenticate via OAuth. The default behavior if this is not defined ``-`` or is an empty string (``""``) or ``null`` is to disallow authentication via OAuth.
	:oauth_user_attribute: An optional username string to be shared with OAuth-capable clients attempting to authenticate via OAuth. The default behavior if this is not defined ``-`` or is an empty string (``""``) or ``null`` is to disallow authentication via OAuth.

		.. warning:: OAuth support in Traffic Ops is still in its infancy, so most users are advised to avoid defining this field without good cause.

	:plugins: An optional array of enabled plugin names. These names must be unique. Note that a plugin that is installed will not be used unless its name appears in this list - thus "enabling" it. If not specified no plugins will be enabled.
	:plugin_config: This optional object maps plugin names - which **must** appear in the ``plugins`` array - to arbitrary JSON configurations for said plugins. It is up to the plugins themselves to parse these configurations. The default if not specified is no configuration information, somewhat obviously.
	:plugin_shared_config: This optional object is just an arbitrary JSON object that is converted into a native object and made available to any and all loaded and enabled plugins. A typical use-case for this field is avoiding repetition of identical configuration in ``plugin_config``. The default if not specified is ``null``.
	:port: Sets the port on which Traffic Ops will listen for incoming connections.
	:profiling_enabled: An optional boolean which, if ``true`` will enable the gathering of profiling statistics on the Traffic Ops server. Default if not specified is ``false``.
	:profiling_location: An optional string which, if set, should be the absolute path (relative paths are allowed but not recommended) to a file where profiling statistics for the Traffic Ops server will be written. If ``profiling_enabled`` is ``true`` but this is not specified, or is an empty string (``""``) or ``null``, then a file named "profiling" will be created or overwritten in the same directory as the file specified in ``log_location_error``. If that file is not a regular file, then Traffic ops will instead create a temporary directory and write profiling statistics to a file named "profiling" within that directory.
	:proxy_keep_alive: Serves no known purpose anymore.
	:proxy_read_handler_timeout: Serves no known purpose anymore.
	:proxy_timeout: Serves no known purpose anymore.
	:proxy_tls_timeout: Serves no known purpose anymore.
	:read_header_timeout: An optional timeout in seconds before which Traffic Ops must be able to finish reading the headers of an incoming request or it will drop the connection. If set to zero, there is no timeout. Default if not specified is zero.
	:read_timeout: An optional timeout in seconds before which Traffic Ops must be able to finish reading an entire incoming request (including body) or it will drop the connection. If set to zero, there is no timeout. Default if not specified is zero.
	:request_timeout: An optional timeout in seconds that serves as the maximum time each Traffic Ops middleware can take to execute. If it is exceeded, the text "server timed out" is served in place of a response. If set to :code:`0`, :code:`60` is used instead. Default if not specified is :code:`60`.
	:riak_port: An optional field that sets the port on which Traffic Ops will try to contact Traffic Vault for storage and retrieval of sensitive encryption keys.

		.. deprecated:: 6.0
			Please use a ``"port"`` field in ``traffic_vault_config`` instead when using ``"traffic_vault_backend": "riak"``.

		.. impl-detail:: The name of this field is derived from the current database used in the implementation of Traffic Vault - `Riak KV <https://riak.com/products/riak-kv/index.html>`_.


	:whitelisted_oauth_url: An optional array of URLs which are allowed to authenticate Traffic Ops users via OAuth. The default behavior if this field is not defined is to not allow OAuth authentication.

		.. warning:: OAuth support in Traffic Ops is still in its infancy, so most users are advised to avoid defining this field without good cause.

	:write_timeout: An optional timeout in seconds set on handlers. After reading a request's header, the server will have this long to send back a response. If set to zero, there is no timeout. Default if not specified is zero.

	:traffic_vault_backend:

		.. versionadded:: 6.0
			Optional. The name of which backend to use for Traffic Vault. Currently, the only supported backend is "riak".

	:traffic_vault_config:

		.. versionadded:: 6.0
			Optional. The JSON configuration which is unique to the chosen Traffic Vault backend. See :ref:`traffic_vault_admin` for the configuration options for each supported backend.

	.. _admin-routing-blacklist:

	:routing_blacklist: Optional configuration for explicitly disabling any routes via ``disabled_routes``.

		.. versionadded:: 4.0

		:perl_routes: Serves no known purpose anymore.

			.. deprecated:: 6.0
				This was used back when Traffic Ops was still in the process of being rewritten from Perl. It serves no purpose anymore, and will be removed in the future.

		:disabled_routes: A list of API route IDs to disable. Requests matching these routes will receive a 503 response. To find the route ID for a given path you would like to disable, run ``./traffic_ops_golang`` using the :option:`--api-routes` option to view all the route information, including route IDs and paths.
		:ignore_unknown_routes: If ``false`` (default) return an error and prevent startup if unknown route IDs are found. Otherwise, log a warning and continue startup.

	:tls_config: An optional stanza for TLS configuration. The values of which conform to the :godoc:`crypto/tls.Config` structure.

:use_ims:

	.. versionadded:: 5.0
		This is an optional boolean value to enable the handling of the "If-Modified-Since" HTTP request header. Default: false

:role_based_permissions: Toggle whether or not to use Role Based Permissions.

	.. versionadded:: 6.1
		The blueprint can be seen :pr:`5848`

:disable_auto_cert_deletion: This optional boolean value can be used to disable the automatic deletion of certificates for Delivery Services that no longer exist (which happens after a CDN Snapshot is taken). Default: false.

	.. versionadded:: 6.1

:cdni: This is an optional section of configurations for :abbr:`CDNi (Content Delivery Network Interconnect)` operations.

	.. versionadded:: 6.2

	:dcdn_id: A string representing this :abbr:`CDN (Content Delivery Network)` to be used in the :abbr:`JWT (JSON Web Token)` and subsequently in :abbr:`CDNi (Content Delivery Network Interconnect)` operations.

:user_cache_refresh_interval_sec: This optional integer value specifies the interval (in seconds) between refreshing the in-memory Users cache. Default: 0 (disabled).

	.. warning:: Enabling the Users cache improves performance by reducing the number of queries made to the Traffic Ops database, but it means that it may take up to this many seconds before any changes to Users and/or Roles are enforced.

	.. versionadded:: 7.0

:server_update_status_cache_refresh_interval_sec: This optional integer value specifies the interval (in seconds) between refreshing the in-memory server update status cache. Default: 0 (disabled).

	.. warning:: Enabling the server update status cache improves performance by reducing the number of queries made to the Traffic Ops database, but it means that it may take up to this many seconds before any server updates or revalidations are reflected in the :ref:`to-api-servers-hostname-update_status` API.

This file deals with configuration of the Traffic Ops Database; in particular it tells Traffic Ops how to connect with the database for its current environment. `traffic_ops_golang`_ will read this file in from the path pointed to by its :option:`--dbcfg` flag. ``database.conf`` is encoded as a JSON object, and its keys are described below.

:dbname: The name of the PostgreSQL database used. Typically different databases are used for different environments, e.g. "trafficops_test", "trafficops", etc. Many environments choose to use ``traffic_ops``.
:description: An optional, human friendly description of the database. Generally this should just describe the purpose of the database e.g. "This database is used for integration testing with our toolset".
:hostname: The hostname (:abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`) of the server that runs the Traffic Ops Database.
:password: The password to use when authenticating with the Traffic Ops database. In a typical install process, the ``postinstall`` script will ask for a password to use for this connection, and this should match that.
:port: The port number (as a string) on which the Traffic Ops Database is listening for incoming connections. `traffic_ops_golang`_ ignores this and always uses the default PostgreSQL port (5432).
:ssl: A boolean that sets whether or not the Traffic Ops Database encrypts its connections with SSL.
:type: A string that gives the "type" of database pointed to by all the other options. Once upon a time it was possible for this to either be "mysql" or "postgres", but the only valid value anymore is "postgres" - and `traffic_ops_golang`_ ignores this field entirely (and in fact doesn't even care if it's defined at all) and only supports "postgres" databases.
:user: The name of the user as whom to connect to the database. In a typical install process, the ``postinstall`` script will ask for the name of a user to set up for the Traffic Ops Database, and this should match that. Many environments choose to use ``traffic_ops``.

Managing Traffic Ops Extensions
===============================
Traffic Ops supports "`Check Extensions`_", which are analytics scripts that collect and display information as columns in the table under :menuselection:`Monitor --> Cache Checks` in Traffic Portal.

.. seealso:: Traffic Ops also supports a more involved type of extension in the form of :ref:`to_go_plugins`.

.. |checkmark| image:: images/good.png
.. |X| image:: images/bad.png

.. _to-check-ext:

Check Extensions
----------------
Check Extensions are scripts that, after registering with Traffic Ops, have a column reserved in the :menuselection:`Monitor --> Cache Checks` view and usually run periodically using :manpage:`cron(8)`. Each extension is a separate executable located in :file:`{$TO_HOME}/bin/checks/` on the Traffic Ops server (though all of the default extensions are written in Perl, this is in *no way* a requirement; they can be any valid executable). The currently registered extensions can be listed by running ``/opt/traffic_ops/app/bin/extensions -a``. Some extensions automatically registered with the Traffic Ops database (``to_extension`` table) at install time (see :atc-file:`traffic_ops/app/db/seeds.sql`). However, :manpage:`cron(8)` must still be configured to run these checks periodically. The extensions are called like so:

.. code-block:: shell
	:caption: Example Check Extension Call

	$TO_HOME/bin/checks/<name>  -c "{\"base_url\": \",https://\"<traffic_ops_ip>\", \"check_name\": \"<check_name>\"}" -l <log level>

:name: The basename of the extension executable
:traffic_ops_ip: The IP address or :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` of the Traffic Ops server
:check_name: The name of the check e.g. ``CDU``, ``CHR``, ``DSCP``, ``MTU``, etc...
:log_level: A whole number between 1 and 4 (inclusive), with 4 being the most verbose. Implementation of this field is optional

It is the responsibility of the check extension script to iterate over the servers it wants to check and post the results. An example script might proceed by logging into the Traffic Ops server using the HTTPS ``base_url`` provided on the command line. The script is hard-coded with an authentication token that is also provisioned in the Traffic Ops User database. This token allows the script to obtain a cookie used in later communications with the Traffic Ops API. The script then obtains a list of all :term:`cache server`\ s to be polled by accessing :ref:`to-api-servers`. This list is then iterated, running a command to gather the stats from each server. For some extensions, an HTTP ``GET`` request might be made to the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` ``astats`` plugin, while for others the server might be pinged, or a command might run over :manpage:`ssh(1)`. The results are then compiled into a numeric or boolean result and the script submits a ``POST`` request containing the result back to Traffic Ops using :ref:`to-api-servercheck`. A check extension can have a column of |checkmark|'s and |X|'s (CHECK_EXTENSION_BOOL) or a column that shows a number (CHECK_EXTENSION_NUM).

	Checks the state of each :term:`cache server` as perceived by all Traffic Monitors (via Traffic Router). This extension asks each Traffic Router for the state of the :term:`cache server`. A check failure is indicated if one or more monitors report an error for a :term:`cache server`. A :term:`cache server` is only marked as good if all reports are positive.

	.. note:: This is a pessimistic approach, opposite of how Traffic Monitor marks a :term:`cache server` as up, i.e. "the optimistic approach".

Example Cron File
-----------------
The :manpage:`cron(8)` file should be edited by running  :manpage:`crontab(1)` as the ``traffops`` user, or with :manpage:`sudo(8)`. You may need to adjust the path to your ``$TO_HOME`` to match your system.
Edit $TO_USER and $TO_PASS to match ORT input parameters.
