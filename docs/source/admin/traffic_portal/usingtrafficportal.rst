Traffic Portal - Using
**********************
Traffic Portal is the official Traffic Control UI. Traffic Portal typically runs on a different machine than Traffic Ops, and works by using the Traffic Ops API. The following high-level items are available in the Traffic Portal menu.

Change Logs
===========
At the top-right of every page is a bubble icon and badge count indicating the number of changes made to the CDN since the last viewing. Clicking on this expands a short list, with an option to :guilabel:`See All Change Logs`. Clicking on this will navigate to the "Changelog" page.

Sidebar Bottom Buttons
======================
At the bottom of the sidebar, a few action buttons may be found. At the far left, is the :guilabel:`Logout` button.

.. figure:: images/logout_button.png
	:align: center

	The Logout Button

Clicking on this button will cause the current user session to end; further use of the Traffic Portal UI will require re-authentication. Next to this is the :guilabel:`User Profile` button.

.. figure:: images/profile_button.png
	:align: center
	:alt: The profile button

	The User Profile Button

Clicking on this button will take the user to his or her user profile page, where much of their information (contact, username etc.) is editable. The next button to the right is the :guilabel:`Release Info` button.

.. figure:: images/release_info_button.png
	:align: center
	:alt: The release info button

	The Release Info Button

When this button is clicked, a modal window will appear, displaying the Traffic Portal version, the date on which it was built, and the network location of the Traffic Ops server that serves the :ref:`to-api` used by the Traffic Portal instance. The final button is the :guilabel:`Popout` button.

.. figure:: images/popout_button.png
	:align: center
	:alt: The popout button

	The Popout Button

This button will open the current view in a new browsing context. Most browsers will implement this as a new tab, but can be configured instead to open them in a new window - check your browser's configuration and set it as desired.

Dashboard
=========
The Dashboard is the default landing page for Traffic Portal. It provides a real-time view into the main performance indicators of the CDNs managed by Traffic Control. It also displays various statistics about the overall health of your CDN.

Current Bandwidth
	The current bandwidth of all of your CDNs.

Current Connections
	The current number of connections to all of your CDNs.

Healthy Caches
	Displays the number of healthy :term:`cache servers` across all CDNs. Click the link to view the healthy caches on the cache stats page.

Unhealthy Caches
	Displays the number of unhealthy :term:`cache servers` across all CDNs. Click the link to view the unhealthy caches on the cache stats page.

Online Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache servers` with ONLINE :term:`Status`. Traffic Monitor will not monitor the state of ONLINE servers.

Reported Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache servers` with REPORTED :term:`Status`.

Offline Caches
	Displays the number of :term:`cache servers` with OFFLINE :term:`Status`.

Admin Down Caches
	Displays the number of caches with ADMIN_DOWN :term:`Status`.

Each component of this view is updated on the intervals defined in the :atc-file:`traffic_portal/app/src/traffic_portal_properties.json` configuration file.

Invalidate Content
------------------
Here, specific assets can be invalidated in all caches of a :term:`Delivery Service`, forcing content to be updated from the origin. Specifically, this *doesn't* mean that :term:`cache servers` will immediately remove items from their caches, but rather will fetch new copies whenever a request is made matching the 'Asset URL' regular expression. This behavior persists until the :term:`Content Invalidation Job`'s :ref:`job-ttl` expires.

.. warning:: This method forces :term:`cache servers` to "re-validate" content, so in order to work properly the :term:`Origin` needs to support revalidation according to section 4.3.2 of :rfc:`7234`.

Each entry in the table on this page has the following fields:

:Delivery Service:  The :term:`Delivery Service` to which to apply this :term:`Content Invalidation Job`
:Asset URL:         A URL or regular expression which describes the asset(s) to be invalidated
:TTL (Hours):       A :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` (as a number of hours) over which the :term:`Content Invalidation Job` shall remain active
:Start:             An effective start time until which the :term:`job` is delayed
:Expires:           The date/time at which the :term:`Content Invalidation Job` will end (effectively "Start" plus "TTL (Hours)")
:Created By:        The user name of the person who created this :term:`Content Invalidation Job`
:Invalidation Type: The :ref:`job-invalidation-type` of this :term:`Content Invalidation Job`

Invalidate content includes the ability to (where applicable):

- create a new :term:`Content Invalidation Job`

.. _tp-tools-generate-iso:

Generate ISO
------------
Generates a boot-able system image for any of the servers in the Servers table (or any server for that matter). Currently it only supports CentOS 7, but if you're brave and pure of heart you MIGHT be able to get it to work with other Unix-like Operating Systems. The interface is *mostly* self-explanatory, but here is a short explanation of the fields in that form.

.. seealso:: For instructions on setting up the Kickstart ISO generation files, see :ref:`Creating-CentOS-Kickstart`.

Copy Server Attributes From
	Optional. This option lets the user choose a server from the Traffic Ops database and will auto-fill the other fields as much as possible based on that server's properties
OS Version
	This list is populated by modifying the :file:`osversions.json` file on the Traffic Ops server. This file maps OS names to the name of a directory under :ref:`kickstart.files.location` (``/var/www/files`` by default).
Hostname
	The desired hostname of the resultant system
Domain
	The desired domain name of the resultant system
DHCP
	If this is 'no' the IP settings of the system must be specified, and the following extra fields will appear:

		IP Address
			The resultant system's IPv4 address
		IPv6 Address
			The resultant system's IPv6 address
		Network Subnet
			The system's network subnet mask
		Network Gateway
			The system's network gateway's IPv4 address
		IPv6 Gateway
			The system's network gateway's IPv6 address
		Management IP Address
			An optional IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of a "management" server for the resultant system (e.g. for :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)`)
		Management IP Netmask
			The subnet mask (IPv4 or IPv6) used by a "management" server for the resultant system (e.g. for :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)`) - only needed if the Management IP Address is provided
		Management IP Gateway
			The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the network gateway used by a "management" server for the resultant system (e.g. for :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)`) - only needed if the Management IP Address is provided
		Management Interface
			The network interface used by a "management" server for the resultant system (e.g. for :abbr:`ILO (Integrated Lights-Out)`) - only needed if the Management IP Address is provided. Must not be the same as "Interface Name".

Network MTU
	The system's network's :abbr:`MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)`. Despite being a text field, this can only be 1500 or 9000 - it should almost always be 1500

		.. seealso:: `The Maximum transmission unit Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit>`_

Disk for OS Install
	The disk on which to install the base system. A reasonable default is ``sda`` (the ``/dev/`` prefix is not necessary)
Root Password
	The password to be used for the root user. Input is hashed using MD5 before being written to disk
Confirm Root Password
	Repeat the 'Root Password' to be sure it's right
Interface Name
	Optional. The name of the resultant system's network interface. Typical values are ``bond0``, ``eth4``, etc. If ``bond0`` is entered, a Link Aggregation Control Protocol bonding configuration will be written

		.. seealso:: `The Link aggregation Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation>`_

Stream ISO
	If this is 'yes', then the download will start immediately as the ISO is written directly to the socket connection from Traffic Ops. If this is 'no', then the download will begin only *after* the ISO has finished being generated. For almost all use cases, this should be 'yes'.

.. impl-detail:: Traffic Ops uses Red Hat's `Kickstart <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/chap-kickstart-installations>` to create these ISOs, so many configuration options not available here can be tweaked in the :ref:`Kickstart configuration file <Creating-CentOS-Kickstart>`.

User Admin
==========
This section offers administrative functionality for users and their permissions.

	The 'User Admin' Menu

User
----
This page lists all the users that are visible to the user (so, for 'admin' users, all users will appear here). Each entry in the table on this page has the following fields:

:Full Name: The user's full, real name
:Username:  The user's username
:Email:     The user's email address
:Tenant:    The user's :term:`Tenant`
:Role:      The user's :term:`Role`

User management includes the ability to (where applicable):

- register a new user
- create a new user
- update an existing user
- view :term:`Delivery Services` visible to a user

.. Note:: If OAuth is enabled, the username must exist both here as well as with the OAuth provider. A user's rights are defined by the :term:`Role` assigned to the user in Traffic Ops. Creating/deleting a user here will update the user's :term:`Role` but the user needs to be created/deleted with the OAuth provider as well.

Tenants
-------
Each entry in the table of :term:`Tenants` on this page has the following entries:

:Name:   The name of the :term:`Tenant`
:Active: If 'true' users of this :term:`Tenant` group are allowed to login and have active :term:`Delivery Services`
:Parent: The parent of this :term:`Tenant`. The default is the 'root' :term:`Tenant`, which has no users.

:term:`Tenant` management includes the ability to (where applicable):

- create a new :term:`Tenant`
- update an existing :term:`Tenant`
- delete an existing :term:`Tenant`
- view users assigned to a :term:`Tenant`
- view :term:`Delivery Services` assigned to a :term:`Tenant`

Roles
-----
Each entry in the table of :term:`Roles` on this page has the following fields:

:Name:            The name of the :term:`Role`
:Privilege Level: The privilege level of this :term:`Role`. This is a whole number that actually controls what a user is allowed to do. Higher numbers correspond to higher permission levels
:Description:     A short description of the :term:`Role` and what it is allowed to do

Role management includes the ability to (where applicable):

- view all :term:`Roles`
- create new :term:`Role`

.. note:: :term:`Roles` cannot be deleted through the Traffic Portal UI
