Traffic Portal
**************
Traffic Portal is only supported on CentOS Linux distributions version 7.x and 8.x. It runs on `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/>`_ and requires version 12 or higher.

Installing
==========
#. Build the Traffic Portal RPM using the instructions in :ref:`dev-building`.
#. Copy the Traffic Portal RPM to your server
#. Install NodeJS. This can be done by building it from source, installing with :manpage:`yum(8)` if it happens to be in your available repositories (at version 12+), or using the NodeSource setup script.

	.. code-block:: bash
		:caption: Installing NodeJS using the NodeSource Setup Script

		curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -

#. Install the Traffic Portal RPM with :manpage:`yum(8)` or :manpage:`rpm(8)` e.g. by running ``yum install path/to/traffic_portal.rpm`` as the root user or with :manpage:`sudo(8)`.


Configuring
===========
Traffic Portal is primarily configured through three different files that affect different parts of its behavior. Those files are detailed in this section.

``/etc/traffic_portal/conf/config.js``
--------------------------------------
This file controls the behavior of the Traffic Portal server. It is a JavaScript source file which **MUST** set ``module.exports`` to the value of a configuration object. Configuration objects have the following allowed properties.

.. tip:: If Traffic Portal is being upgraded, reconcile ``config.js`` with ``config.js.rpmnew`` and then delete ``config.js.rpmnew``.

:api: The properties of this object control Traffic Portal's interactions with the :ref:`to-api`.

	:base_url: The **full** URL that points to the root of the :ref:`to-api`, e.g. ``https://trafficops.infra.ciab.test:443/api/`` **not** ``https://trafficops.infra.ciab.test:443`` or ``https://trafficops.infra.ciab.test:443/api`` (trailing ``/`` required).

:files: The properties of this object describe system paths important to Traffic Portal (other than SSL-related files, which are kept in the ``ssl`` object).

	:static: The directory where the built Traffic Portal front-end files are kept. In most cases, changing this from the default is unnecessary/discouraged.

:log: The properties of this object describe the logging behavior of Traffic Portal. If this property is missing, or is ``null`` (or other "falsey" values), then logging is done simply on STDOUT.

	:stream: Defines a file location for Traffic Portal's access logs. If this property is missing, or is ``null`` (or other "falsey" values), then logs will go to STDOUT instead.

:port:                A port number that sets the port on which Traffic Portal will listen for insecure (HTTP) connections. If ``useSSL`` is ``false``, requests made to this port will be redirected to use HTTPS on the ``sslPort`` instead of just serving content insecurely.
:reject_unauthorized: A boolean that defines whether or not Traffic Portal will reject SSL certificates that fail to validate as trusted.

	.. caution:: Setting this to ``false`` exposes Traffic Portal to security vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks, and should *never* be done in a production setting.

:ssl: This object has properties that set the locations of SSL keys and certificates. Has no effect if ``useSSL`` is ``false``.

	:key:  The file location of the SSL certificate private key.
	:cert: The file location of the x509 SSL certificate that Traffic Portal will use.
	:ca:   The file locations of the full certificate chain for the certificate authority that signed the SSL key (in order).

:sslPort: A port number that sets the port on which Traffic Portal will listen for secure (HTTPS) connections. Has no effect if ``useSSL`` is ``false``.
:useSSL: A boolean that defines whether or not the Traffic Portal instance will offer secure (HTTPS) connections.

	.. caution:: Setting this to ``false`` can expose sensitive data such as authentication credentials. Do not *ever* do that in a production setting.

:timeout: This property defines the maximum time for which Traffic Portal will process requests before sending a timeout response. It can be either a number of milliseconds, or a duration string accepted by `the ms library <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms#readme>`_.

	.. warning:: Slow requests will continue to use CPU and memory, even though a response has already been sent to the client.

``/opt/traffic_portal/public/traffic_portal_properties.json``
-------------------------------------------------------------
- update :file:`/opt/traffic_portal/public/traffic_portal_properties.json` (if Traffic Portal is being upgraded, reconcile :file:`traffic_portal_properties.json` with :file:`traffic_portal_properties.json.rpmnew` and then delete :file:`traffic_portal_properties.json.rpmnew`)

``/opt/traffic_portal/public/resources/assets/css/custom.css``
--------------------------------------------------------------
This :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)` file is provided for users to insert CSS to override the default styling of Traffic Portal.

Configuring OAuth Through Traffic Portal
========================================
See :ref:`oauth_login`.


Starting Traffic Portal
=======================
The Traffic Portal RPM comes with a :manpage:`systemd(1)` unit file, so under normal circumstances Traffic Portal may be started with :manpage:`systemctl(1)`.

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Starting Traffic Portal

	systemctl start traffic_portal

Stopping Traffic Portal
=======================
The Traffic Portal RPM comes with a :manpage:`systemd(1)` unit file, so under normal circumstances Traffic Portal may be stopped with :manpage:`systemctl(1)`.

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Stopping Traffic Portal

	systemctl stop traffic_portal
