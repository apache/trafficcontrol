Release Notes v3.0
==================
* Replaced custom Java :abbr:`SNI (Server Name Indication)` implementation with a native implementation using tomcat-native, :abbr:`APR (Apache Portable Runtime)` and OpenSSL. This should significantly improve the performance of routing HTTPS :term:`Delivery Services`.

	.. seealso:: `The Server Name Indication Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_, `The Apache Portable Runtime project site <https://apr.apache.org/>`_ and/or `the OpenSSL project site <https://www.openssl.org/>`_

* Upgraded to Tomcat 8.5.30
* Separated the Traffic Router installation from the Tomcat deployment and created a new 'tomcat' package for installing Tomcat. Traffic Router and Tomcat can now be upgraded independently
* Converted Traffic Router to a :manpage:`systemd(1)` service
* Modified the development test and deployment processes to be more consistent with production

System Requirements
===================
* Centos 7.2
* OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 installed
* JDK >= 8.0 installed or available in an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository
* :abbr:`APR (Apache Portable Runtime)` >= 1.4.8-3 installed or available in an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository
* Tomcat Native >= 1.2.16 installed or available in an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository
* tomcat >= 8.5-30 installed or available in an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository (This package is created automatically by the Traffic Router build process)

Upgrade Procedure
=================
* upload the :file:`dist/tomcat-{version string}.rpm` file generated as a part of the build instructions outlined in :ref:`dev-building` to an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository
* update the ``traffic_router`` package with :manpage:`yum(8)`
* restore property files

Upload tomcat.rpm
-----------------
The :file:`term-{version string}.rpm` package should have been created when Traffic Router was built according to the instructions in :ref:`dev-building`. It must must either be added to an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository, or manually copied to the servers where Traffic Router will be installed. It is generally better that it be added to a :manpage:`yum(8)` repository because then it will be installed automatically when Traffic Router is updated.

Update the traffic_router Package
---------------------------------
If ``openssl``, ``apr``, ``tomcat-native``, ``java-1.8.0-openjdk``, ``java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`` and ``tomcat_tr`` packages are all in an available :manpage:`yum(8)` repository then an upgrade can be performed by running ``yum update traffic_router`` as the root user or with :manpage:`sudo(8)`. This will first cause the ``apr``, ``tomcat-native``, ``java-1.8.0-openjdk``, ``java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`` and ``tomcat`` packages to be installed. When the ``tomcat`` package runs, it will cause any older versions of ``traffic_router`` or ``tomcat`` to be uninstalled. This is because the previous versions of the ``traffic_router`` package included an untracked installation of ``tomcat``.

Restore Property Files
----------------------
The install process does not override or replace any of the files in the :file:`/opt/traffic_router/conf` directory. Previous versions of the :file:`traffic_ops.properties`, :file:`traffic_monitor.properties` and :file:`startup.properties` should still be good. On a new install replace the Traffic Router properties files with the correct ones for the CDN.

Development Environment Upgrade
===============================
If a development environment is already set up for the previous version of Traffic Router, then ``openssl``, ``apr`` and ``tomcat-native`` will need to be manually installed with :manpage:`yum(8)` or :manpage:`rpm(8)`. Also, whenever either ``mvn clean verify`` or ``TrafficRouterStart`` is/are run, the location of the ``tomcat-native`` libraries will need to be made known to the :abbr:`JVM (Java Virtual Machine)` via command line arguments.
