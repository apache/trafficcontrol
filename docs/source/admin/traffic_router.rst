*****************************
Traffic Router Administration
*****************************

Requirements
============
* CentOS 7 or later
* 4 CPUs
* 8GB of RAM
* Successful install of Traffic Ops (usually on another machine)
* Successful install of Traffic Monitor (usually on another machine)
* Administrative access to Traffic Ops

.. Note:: Hardware requirements are generally doubled if :ref:`tr-DNSSEC` is enabled

Installing Traffic Router
=========================
#. If no suitable :term:`Profile` exists, create a new :term:`Profile` for Traffic Router via the :guilabel:`+` button on the :ref:`tp-configure-profiles` page in Traffic Portal

	.. warning:: Traffic Ops will *only* recognize a :term:`Profile` as assignable to a Traffic Router if its :ref:`profile-name` starts with the prefix ``ccr-``. The reason for this is a legacy limitation related to the old name for Traffic Router (Comcast Cloud Router), and will (hopefully) be rectified in the future.

#. Enter the Traffic Router server into Traffic Portal on the :ref:`tp-configure-servers` page (or via the :ref:`to-api`), assign to it a Traffic Router :term:`Profile`, and ensure that its status is set to ``ONLINE``.
#. Ensure the :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` of the Traffic Router is resolvable in DNS. This :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` must be resolvable by the clients expected to use this CDN.
#. Install a Traffic Router server package, either from source or using a :file:`traffic_router-{version string}.rpm` package generated using the instructions in :ref:`dev-building`.

	.. versionchanged:: 3.0
		As of version 3.0, Traffic Router depends upon a package called ``tomcat``. This package should have been created when Traffic Router was built. If installing the ``traffic_router`` produces a depenedency error, make sure that the ``tomcat`` package is available in an accessible :manpage:`yum(8)` repository.

#. Edit :file:`/opt/traffic_router/conf/traffic_monitor.properties` and specify the correct online Traffic Monitor(s) for your CDN.

	.. seealso:: :ref:`tr-config-files`

	:file:`traffic_monitor.properties`
		URL that should normally point to this file, e.g. ``traffic_monitor.properties=file:/opt/traffic_router/conf/traffic_monitor.properties``
	:file:`traffic_monitor.properties.reload.period`
		Period to wait (in milliseconds) between reloading this file, e.g. ``traffic_monitor.properties.reload.period=60000``

#. Start Traffic Router. This is normally done by starting its :manpage:`systemd(1)` service. ``systemctl start traffic_router`` , and test DNS lookups against that server to be sure it's resolving properly. with e.g. ``dig`` or ``curl``. Also, because previously taken CDN :term:`Snapshots` will be cached, they need to be removed manually to actually be reloaded. This file should be located at :file:`/opt/traffic_router/db/cr-config.json`. This should be done before starting or restarting Traffic Router.

#. Perform a CDN :term:`Snapshot`.

	.. Note:: Once the :term:`Snapshot` is taken, live traffic will be sent to the new Traffic Routers provided that their status has been set to ``ONLINE``.

#. Ensure that the parent domain (e.g.: ``cdn.local``) for the CDN's top level domain (e.g.: ``ciab.cdn.local``) contains a delegation (Name Server records) for the new Traffic Router, and that the value specified matches the :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` of the Traffic Router.

Configuring Traffic Router
==========================
.. versionchanged:: 1.5
	Many of the configuration files under :file:`/opt/traffic_router/conf` are now only needed to override the default configuration values for Traffic Router. Most of the given default values will work well for any CDN. Critical values that must be changed are hostnames and credentials for communicating with other Traffic Control components such as Traffic Ops and Traffic Monitor. Pre-existing installations that store configuration files under ``/opt/traffic_router/conf`` will still be used and honored for Traffic Router 1.5 onward.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
	Traffic Router 3.0 has been converted to a formal Tomcat instance, meaning that is now installed separately from the Tomcat servlet engine. The Traffic Router installation package contains all of the Traffic Router-specific software, configuration and startup scripts including some additional configuration files needed for Tomcat. These new configuration files can all be found in the :file:`/opt/traffic_router/conf` directory and generally serve to override Tomcat's default settings.

For the most part, the configuration files and :term:`Parameters` used by Traffic Router are used to bring it online and start communicating with various Traffic Control components. Once Traffic Router is successfully communicating with Traffic Control, configuration should mostly be performed in Traffic Portal, and will be distributed throughout Traffic Control via CDN :term:`Snapshot` process.

.. _consistent-hashing:

Consistent Hashing
==================
Traffic Router does special optimization for some requests to ensure that requests for specific content are consistently fetched from a small number (often exactly one, but dependent on :ref:`ds-initial-dispersion`) of :term:`cache servers` - thus ensuring it stays "fresh" in the cache. This is done by performing "consistent hashing" on request paths (when HTTP routing) or names requested for resolution (when DNS routing). To an extent, this behavior is configurable by modifying fields on :term:`Delivery Services`. Consistent hashing acts differently on a :term:`Delivery Service` based on how :term:`Delivery Services` of its :ref:`ds-types` route content.

- HTTP, HTTP_NO_CACHE, HTTP_LIVE, HTTP_LIVE_NATNL, DNS, DNS_LIVE, and DNS_NATNL
	These :ref:`Delivery Service Types <ds-types>` route directly to :term:`cache servers`, so consistent hashing is used to choose a :term:`cache server` to which the client will be redirected.

- STEERING and CLIENT_STEERING
	These :ref:`Delivery Service Types <ds-types>` route to "target" :term:`Delivery Services`, so consistent hashing is used to choose a "target" which will service the client request.

.. seealso:: See `the Wikipedia article on consistent hashing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing>`_.

.. _pattern-based-consistenthash:

Consistent Hashing Patterns
---------------------------
.. versionadded:: 4.0

Regular expressions ("patterns") can be provided in the :ref:`ds-consistent-hashing-regex` field of an HTTP-:ref:`routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service to influence what parts of an HTTP request path are considered when performing consistent hashing. These patterns propagate to Traffic Router through :term:`Snapshots`.

.. important:: Consistent Hashing Patterns on STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` :term:`Delivery Services` will be used for Consistent Hashing - the Consistent Hashing Pattern(s) of said :term:`Delivery Service`'s target(s) will **not** be considered. If Consistent Hashing Patterns are important to the routing of content on a STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` or CLIENT_STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` :term:`Delivery Service`, they **must** be defined *on that* :term:`Delivery Service` *itself, and* **not** *on its target(s)*.

How it Works
""""""""""""
The supplied :ref:`ds-consistent-hashing-regex` is applied to the request path to extract matching elements to build a new string *before* consistent hashing is done. For example, using the pattern :regexp:`/.*?(/.*?/).*?(m3u8)` and given the request paths ``/test/path/asset.m3u8`` and ``/other/path/asset.m3u8`` the resulting string used for consistent hashing will be ``/path/m3u8``

.. seealso:: See Oracle's `documentation for the java.util.regex.Pattern <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html>`_ implementation in Java.

Testing Pattern-Based Consistent Hashing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In order to test this feature without affecting the delivery of traffic through a CDN, there are several test tools in place.

- :ref:`tr-api`
	Several Traffic Router endpoints exist to test regular expression application against a request path, :term:`cache server` selection, and :term:`Delivery Service` selection.
- :ref:`to-api`
	The :ref:`to-api-consistenthash` endpoint will proxy request data through to one of the Traffic Router endpoints in order to test regular expression application against a request path, in the event that direct access to the :ref:`tr-api` is not possible and/or desired.
- Traffic Portal
	On the :term:`Delivery Service` creation/modification form in Traffic Portal (under :ref:`tp-services-delivery-service`), there is a :guilabel:`Test Regex` section that the user can use to validate a regular expression before saving it to a :term:`Delivery Service`.

Consistent Hash Query Parameters
--------------------------------
Normally, when performing consistent hashing for an HTTP-:ref:`routed <ds-types>` :term:`Delivery Service`, any query parameters present in the request are ignored. That is, if a client requests ``/some/path?key=value`` consistent hashing is only performed on the string '``/some/path``'. However, query parameters that are part of uniquely identifying content can be specified by adding them to the set of :ref:`ds-consistent-hashing-qparams` of a :term:`Delivery Service`. For example, suppose that the file ``/video.mp4`` is available on the :term:`origin server` in different resolutions, which are specified by the ``resolution`` query parameter. This means that ``/video.mp4?resolution=480p`` and ``/video.mp4?resolution=720p`` share a *request path*, but represent different *content*. In that case, adding ``resolution`` to the :term:`Delivery Service`'s :ref:`ds-consistent-hashing-qparams` will cause consistent hashing to be done on e.g. ``/video.mp4?resolution=480p`` instead of just ``/video.mp4`` - however if the client requests e.g. ``/video.mp4?resolution=480p&bitrate=120kbps`` consistent hashing will *only* consider ``/video.mp4?resolution=480p``.

.. note:: `Consistent Hashing Patterns`_ are applied *before* query parameters are considered - i.e. a pattern cannot match against query parameters, and need not worry about query parameters contaminating matches.

.. important:: Consistent Hash Query Parameters on the *targets* of STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` :term:`Delivery Services` will be used for Consistent Hashing - the Consistent Hash Query Parameters of said :term:`Delivery Services` themselves will **not** be considered. If Consistent Hash Query Parameters are important to the routing of content on a STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` or CLIENT_STEERING-:ref:`ds-types` :term:`Delivery Service`, they **must** be defined *on that* :term:`Delivery Service`'s' *target(s), and* **not** *on the* :term:`Delivery Service` *itself*.

.. caution:: Certain query parameters are reserved by Traffic Router for its own use, and thus cannot be present in any Consistent Hash Query Parameters. These reserved parameters are:

	- trred
	- format
	- fakeClientIPAddress

.. _tr-dnssec:

DNSSEC
======
.. seealso:: `The Wikipedia page on Domain Name Security Extensions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions>`_

Overview
--------
:abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` is a set of extensions to DNS that provides a cryptographic mechanism for resolvers to verify the authenticity of responses served by an authoritative DNS server. Several RFCs (:rfc:`4033`, :rfc:`4044`, :rfc:`4045`) describe the low level details and define the extensions, :rfc:`7129` provides clarification around authenticated denial of existence of records, and finally :rfc:`6781` describes operational best practices for administering an authoritative :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)`-enabled DNS server. The authenticated denial of existence :rfc:`7129` describes how an authoritative DNS server responds in NXDOMAIN and NODATA scenarios when :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` is enabled. Traffic Router currently supports :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` with :abbr:`NSEC (Next Secure Record)`, however, :abbr:`NSEC3 (Next Secure Record version 3)` and more configurable options are planned for the future.

Operation
---------
Upon startup or a configuration change, Traffic Router obtains keys from the 'keystore' API in Traffic Ops which returns :abbr:`KSK (Key Signing Key)`\ s and :abbr:`ZSK (Zone Signing Key)`\ s for each :term:`Delivery Service` that is a sub-domain of the CDN's :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)` in addition to the keys for the CDN :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)` itself. Each key has timing information that allows Traffic Router to determine key validity (expiration, inception, and effective dates) in addition to the appropriate :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` to use for the DNSKEY record(s). All :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)`\ s are configurable :term:`Parameters` in :ref:`tr-profile`.

Once Traffic Router obtains the key data from the API, it converts each public key into the appropriate record types (DNSKEY, DS) to place in zones and uses the private key to sign zones. DNSKEY records are added to each :term:`Delivery Service`'s zone (e.g.: ``demo1.mycdn.ciab.test``) for every valid key that exists, in addition to the CDN :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)`'s zone. A DS record is generated from each zone's :abbr:`KSK (Key Signing Key)` and is placed in the CDN :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)`'s zone (e.g.: ``mycdn.ciab.test``); the DS record for the CDN :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)` must be placed in its parent zone, which is not managed by Traffic Control.

The DNSKEY to DS record relationship allows resolvers to validate signatures across zone delegation points. With Traffic Control, we control all delegation points below the CDN's :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)`, **however, the DS record for the CDN** :abbr:`TLD (Top Level Domain)` **must be placed in the parent zone** (e.g.: ``ciab.test``), **which is not managed by Traffic Control**. As such, the DS record must be placed in the parent zone prior to enabling :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)`, and prior to generating a new CDN KSK. Based on your deployment's DNS configuration, this might be a manual process or it might be automated. Either way, extreme care and diligence must be taken and knowledge of the management of the upstream zone is imperative for a successful :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` deployment.

To enable :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` for a CDN in Traffic Portal, Go to :guilabel:`CDNs` from the sidebar and click on the desired CDN, then toggle the 'DNSSEC Enabled' field to 'true', and click on the green :guilabel:`Update` button to save the changes.

Rolling Zone Signing Keys
-------------------------
Traffic Router currently follows the :abbr:`ZSK (Zone Signing Key)` pre-publishing operational best practice described in :rfc:`6781#section-4.1.1.1`. Once :abbr:`DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)` is enabled for a CDN in Traffic Portal, key rolls are triggered by Traffic Ops via the automated key generation process, and Traffic Router selects the active :abbr:`ZSK (Zone Signing Keys)`\ s based on the expiration information returned from the 'keystore' API of Traffic Ops.

.. _tr-edge_traffic_routing:

Edge Traffic Routing
====================

Overview
--------
Edge Traffic Routing is a feature that enables localization for more DNS record types than just the routing name for DNS delivery services. This feature has two main components: localization of HTTP delivery service routing names and localization for CDN-managed NS records. This allows Traffic Router to scale horizontally more easily, as there is a practical limit to how many records can be in an RRset for ``NS``, ``A``, or ``AAAA`` record types. The practical limit is typically an answer size exceeding 512 bytes; we have observed issues where some clients and/or resolvers do not honor larger answer responses, while in some cases, resolvers are unable to use TCP for larger responses. Additionally, this feature allows Traffic Router to serve an RRset containing only Traffic Routers that are near the client (resolver), placing more control over which Traffic Routers a given resolver or client will interact with.

Localizing ``NS`` records reduces latency for the resolver, which, due to caching in DNS is of little utility for ``NS`` records, but it will force resolvers to use the closest Traffic Routers for all queries. This is important for look-ups of CDN routing name records that have very short TTLs, meaning DNS traffic for routing name records is frequent. Like localization for routing names of DNS delivery services, localizing the routing name for HTTP delivery services provides the client (end user) with a list of Traffic Routers that are physically close, reducing latency when the client moves from DNS resolution to the HTTP connection to Traffic Router for the 302 redirect to the edge cache. This feature reduces latency between a resolver and Traffic Router, reduces latency for the client's HTTP request to Traffic Router, and allows Traffic Control to dictate which Traffic Routers are used in any given location when a client can be localized.

Edge DNS Routing
----------------
Edge DNS routing refers to the localization of ``NS`` records in Traffic Router. This can be turned on and off via the ``edge.dns.routing`` parameter; the number of records returned is controlled via ``edge.dns.limit`` and there is a hard-coded default limit of 4 when this feature is enabled. See :ref:`tr-profile` documentation for parameter details.

Edge HTTP Routing
-----------------
Edge HTTP routing refers to the localization of ``A`` and ``AAAA`` records that represent routing names for HTTP delivery services. This can be turned on and off via the ``edge.http.routing`` parameter; the number of records returned is controlled via ``edge.http.limit`` and there is a hard-coded default limit of 4 when this feature is enabled. The default or global limit can be overridden by modifying the ``maxDnsAnswers`` setting on the delivery service. See :ref:`tr-profile` documentation for parameter details.

Edge Traffic Router Selection
-----------------------------
Traffic Router performs localization on client requests in order to determine which Traffic Routers should service a given request. After localization, Traffic Router will perform a consistent hash on the incoming name and will use the value to refine Traffic Router selection. There are two main cases for Traffic Router selection: a localization hit, and a localization miss.

Localization Hit: Consistent Hash (CH)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When a client is localized, Traffic Router selects the nearest Traffic Router Location (:term:`Cache Group`) based on proximity. Proximity is determined by using the latitude and longitude of the client, regardless of whether it is a coverage zone or geolocation hit, and the latitude and longitude specified on Traffic Router Locations. Once the location is identified, a consistent hash is performed on the incoming name and the list of Traffic Routers is ordered based upon the consistent hash. Once ordered, the list is limited to the appropriate number based on the limit parameter specified by the hard-coded default (4), ``edge.dns.limit``, ``edge.http.limit``, or ``maxDnsAnswers``, depending on the configuration and request being localized. This approach can be thought of as the :abbr:`CH (consistent hash)` selection process.

Localization Miss: Consistent Hash + Round Robin (CH + RR)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
When a client cannot be localized, Traffic Router still needs to produce a list of Traffic Routers to service the request. Because the number of Traffic Routers in the CDN could far exceed the practical limits of what constitutes a "normal" sized answer, a selection algorithm is applied to select Traffic Routers. Much like the localization hit scenario, the incoming request name is consistent hashed and results size is limited by the same parameters. Because no client location is known, Traffic Router must distribute the load across all Traffic Router Locations. To distribute the load, Traffic Router will order all Traffic Routers at each location based on the consistent hash, selecting a Traffic Router at the nth position, incrementing the index, n, after iterating over all locations.

For example, with four Traffic Router Locations each containing 10 Traffic Routers and a limit of 6, the algorithm would:

- Consistent hash the incoming name
- Order the Traffic Routers at each location by the consistent hash
- Select the Traffic Router at at the first position of each location
- Select the Traffic Router at the second position of each location, stopping after selecting the 6th Traffic Router

Because the algorithm employs consistent hashing, the answers should be consistent as long as the topology remains the same. This approach can be thought of as the consistent hash round robin (CH + RR) selection process.

Example Request Flow
""""""""""""""""""""
The following is an example of the request flow when a client requests the routing name for an example delivery service, ``tr.service.cdn.example.com``. The request flow assumes that the resolver is cold and has yet to build a local cache of look-ups, meaning it has to walk the domain hierarchy asking for ``NS`` records until it reaches ``service.cdn.example.com``. This example starts after the resolver has determined which name servers are authoritative for ``cdn.example.com``. Note that the same logic is applied for each of the three queries made by the resolver.

.. _deep-cache:

Deep Caching
============

Overview
--------
Deep Caching is a feature that enables clients to be routed to the closest possible "deep" Edge-tier :term:`cache servers` on a per-:term:`Delivery Service` basis. The term "deep" is used in the networking sense, meaning that the Edge-tier :term:`cache servers` are located deep in the network where the number of network hops to a client is as minimal. This deep caching topology is desirable because storing content closer to the client gives better bandwidth savings, and sometimes the cost of bandwidth usage in the network outweighs the cost of adding storage. While it may not be feasible to cache an entire copy of the CDN's contents in every deep location (for the best possible bandwidth savings), storing just a relatively small amount of the CDN's most requested content can lead to very high bandwidth savings.

What You Need
-------------
#. Edge cache deployed in "deep" locations and registered in Traffic Ops
#. A :term:`Deep Coverage Zone File` mapping these deep cache hostnames to specific network prefixes
#. Deep caching :term:`Parameters` in the Traffic Router :term:`Profile`

	- ``deepcoveragezone.polling.interval``
	- ``deepcoveragezone.polling.url``

	.. seealso:: See :ref:`tr-profile` for details.

#. Deep Caching enabled on one or more HTTP :term:`Delivery Services` (i.e. 'Deep Caching' field on the :term:`Delivery Service` details page (under :guilabel:`Advanced Options`) set to ``ALWAYS``)

How it Works
------------
Deep Coverage Zone routing is very similar to that of regular Coverage Zone routing, except that the :abbr:`DCZF (Deep Coverage Zone File)` is preferred over the regular :abbr:`CZF (Coverage Zone File)` for :term:`Delivery Services` with Deep Caching enabled. If the client requests a Deep Caching-enabled :term:`Delivery Service` and their IP address gets a "hit" in the :abbr:`DCZF (Deep Coverage Zone File)`, Traffic Router will attempt to route that client to one of the available "deep" :term:`cache servers` in the client's corresponding zone. If there are no "deep" :term:`cache servers` available for a client's request, Traffic Router will fall back to the regular :abbr:`CZF (Coverage Zone File)` and continue regular :abbr:`CZF (Coverage Zone File)` routing from there.

.. _tr-steering:

Steering Feature
================

Overview
--------
A Steering :term:`Delivery Service` is a :term:`Delivery Service` that is used to route a client to another :term:`Delivery Service`. The :ref:`Type <ds-types>` of a Steering :term:`Delivery Service` is either STEERING or CLIENT_STEERING. A Steering :term:`Delivery Service` will have target :term:`Delivery Services` configured for it with weights assigned to them. Traffic Router uses the weights to make a consistent hash ring which it then uses to make sure that requests are routed to a target based on the configured weights. This consistent hash ring is separate from the consistent hash ring used in cache selection.

Special regular expressions - referred to as 'filters' - can also be configured for target :term:`Delivery Services` to pin traffic to a specific :term:`Delivery Service`. For example, if the filter :regexp:`.*/news/.*` for a target called ``target-ds-1`` is created, any requests to Traffic Router with "news" in them will be routed to ``target-ds-1``. This will happen regardless of the configured weights.

Some other points of interest
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Steering is currently only available for HTTP :term:`Delivery Services` that are a part of the same CDN.
- A new role called STEERING has been added to the Traffic Ops database. Only users with the Steering :term:`Role` or higher can modify steering assignments for a :term:`Delivery Service`.
- Traffic Router uses the steering endpoints of the :ref:`to-api` to poll for steering assignments, the assignments are then used when routing traffic.

A couple simple use-cases for Steering are:

- Migrating traffic from one :term:`Delivery Service` to another over time.
- Trying out new functionality for a subset of traffic with an experimental :term:`Delivery Service`.
- Load balancing between :term:`Delivery Services`

The Difference Between STEERING and CLIENT_STEERING
---------------------------------------------------
The only difference between the STEERING and CLIENT_STEERING :term:`Delivery Service` :term:`Types` is that CLIENT_STEERING explicitly allows a client to bypass Steering by choosing a destination :term:`Delivery Service`. A client can accomplish this by providing the ``X-TC-Steering-Option`` HTTP header with a value of the ``xml_id`` of the target :term:`Delivery Service` to which they desire to be routed. When Traffic Router receives this header it will route to the requested target :term:`Delivery Service` regardless of weight configuration. This header is ignored by STEERING :term:`Delivery Services`.

Configuration
-------------
The following needs to be completed for Steering to work correctly:

#. Two target :term:`Delivery Services` are created in Traffic Ops. They must both be HTTP :term:`Delivery Services` part of the same CDN.
#. A :term:`Delivery Service` with type STEERING or CLIENT_STEERING is created in Traffic Portal.
#. Target :term:`Delivery Services` are assigned to the Steering :term:`Delivery Service` using Traffic Portal.
#. A user with the role of Steering is created.
#. The Steering user assigns weights to the target :term:`Delivery Services`.
#. If desired, the Steering user can create filters for the target :term:`Delivery Services`.

.. seealso:: For more information see :ref:`steering-qht`.

HTTPS for HTTP Delivery Services
================================
.. versionadded:: 1.7
	Traffic Router now has the ability to allow HTTPS traffic between itself and clients on a per-HTTP :term:`Delivery Service` basis.

.. Note:: As of version 3.0 Traffic Router has been integrated with native OpenSSL. This makes establishing HTTPS connections to Traffic Router much less expensive than previous versions. However establishing an HTTPS connection is more computationally demanding than an HTTP connection. Since each client will in turn get redirected to an :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` instance, Traffic Router is most always creating a new HTTPS connection for all HTTPS traffic. It is likely to mean that an existing Traffic Router may have some decrease in performance if you wish to support a lot of HTTPS traffic. As noted for :abbr:`DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)`, you may need to plan to scale Traffic Router vertically and/or horizontally to handle the new load.

The HTTPS set up process is:

#. Select one of '1 - HTTPS', '2 - HTTP AND HTTPS', or '3 - HTTP TO HTTPS' for the :term:`Delivery Service`
#. Generate private keys for the :term:`Delivery Service` using a wildcard domain such as ``*.my-delivery-service.my-cdn.example.com``
#. Obtain and import signed certificate chain
#. Perform a CDN :term:`Snapshot`

Clients may make HTTPS requests to :term:`Delivery Services` only after the CDN :term:`Snapshot` propagates to Traffic Router and it receives the certificate chain from Traffic Ops.

Protocol Options
----------------
HTTP
	Any secure client will get an SSL handshake error. Non-secure clients will experience the same behavior as prior to 1.7
HTTPS
	Traffic Router will only redirect (send a ``302 Found`` response) to clients communicating with a secure connection, all other clients will receive a ``503 Service Unavailable`` response
HTTP AND HTTPS
	Traffic Router will redirect both secure and non-secure clients
HTTP TO HTTPS
	Traffic Router will redirect non-secure clients with a ``302 Found`` response and a location that is secure (i.e. an ``https://`` URL instead of an ``http://`` URL), while secure clients will be redirected immediately to an appropriate target or :term:`cache server`.

Certificate Retrieval
---------------------
.. Warning:: If you have HTTPS :term:`Delivery Services` in your CDN, Traffic Router will not accept **any** connections until it is able to fetch certificates from Traffic Ops and load them into memory. Traffic Router does not persist certificates to the Java Keystore or anywhere else.

Traffic Router fetches certificates into memory:

* At startup time
* When it receives a new CDN :term:`Snapshot`
* Once an hour starting whenever the most recent of the last of the above occurred

.. Note:: To adjust the frequency at which Traffic Router fetches certificates add the :term:`Parameter` ``certificates.polling.interval`` with the ConfigFile "CRConfig.json" and set it to the desired duration in milliseconds.

.. Note:: Taking a CDN :term:`Snapshot` may be used at times to avoid waiting the entire polling cycle for a new set of certificates.

.. Warning:: If a CDN :term:`Snapshot` is taken that involves a :term:`Delivery Service` missing its certificates, Traffic Router will ignore **ALL** changes in that CDN :term:`Snapshot` until one of the following occurs:

	* It receives certificates for that :term:`Delivery Service`
	* Another CDN :term:`Snapshot` is taken and the :term:`Delivery Service` without certificates is changed such that its HTTP protocol is set to 'http'

Certificate Chain Ordering
--------------------------
The ordering of certificates within the certificate bundle matters. It must be:

#. Primary Certificate (e.g. the one created for ``*.my-delivery-service.my-cdn.example.com``)
#. Intermediate Certificate(s)
#. Root Certificate from a :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` (optional)

.. Warning:: If something is wrong with the certificate chain (e.g. the order of the certificates is backwards or for the wrong domain) the client will get an SSL handshake. Inspection of ``/opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.log`` is likely to yield information to reveal this.

To see the ordering of certificates you may have to manually split up your certificate chain and use :manpage:`openssl(1ssl)` on each individual certificate

Automatic Certificate Management Environment
--------------------------------------------
Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) is a protocol for automatically generating, renewing, and revoking SSL certificates.  Currently, :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` can be used through :ref:`lets_encrypt` or through :ref:`external_account_binding`.

.. _external_account_binding:

External Account Binding
------------------------
External account binding allows the user to use an existing account with an :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider to obtain, renew, and revoke SSL certificates.
To use this functionality, fill in the fields in :ref:`cdn.conf` for the :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider with which the account is set up.
The first time this is used for a specific :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider (defined by the `acme_provider` and `user_email` fields) the information will be used to get a private key and account URL from the :abbr:`ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment)` provider and register the account. These will be stored for later use.
External account binding information can only be used once, so after the first time, the private key and URL will be used.

.. Important:: The `acme_provider` and `user_email` combination must be unique.  The `acme_provider` field must correlate to the `AuthType` field for each certificate to be renewed using that provider.

External account binding can be set up through :ref:`cdn.conf` by updating the following fields:

Let's Encrypt
-------------
Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` using :abbr:`ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment)` protocol. Let's Encrypt performs a domain validation before issuing or renewing a certificate. There are several options for domain validation but for this application the DNS challenge is used in order to receive wildcard certificates. Let's Encrypt sends a token to be used as a TXT record at ``_acme-challenge.domain.example.com`` and after verifying that the token is accessible there, will return the newly generated and signed certificate and key. The basic workflow implemented is:

#. ``POST`` to Let's Encrypt and receive the DNS challenge token.
#. Traffic Ops stores the DNS challenge.
#. Traffic Router has a watcher which checks with Traffic Ops for any new challenges or deleted challenges.
#. When a new record appears, Traffic Router temporarily adds a static route for the specified :term:`Delivery Service` with the token from Let's Encrypt at ``_acme-challenge.domain.example.com``.
#. Let's Encrypt continuously attempts to resolve it as a TXT record to verify ownership of the domain.

.. Note:: DNSSec should be turned on for any CDN using Let's Encrypt to guard against a 'Man in the Middle' interference with this transaction.

#. Let's Encrypt returns the signed certificate and key to Traffic Ops.
#. Traffic Ops stores the certificate and key in Traffic Vault and removes the DNS challenge record.
#. The Traffic Router watcher removes the TXT record.

Let's Encrypt can be set up through :ref:`cdn.conf` by updating the following fields:

Automatic Certificate Renewal
-----------------------------
If desired, an automated certificate renewal script is located at :file:`/traffic_ops/etc/cron.d/autorenew_certs`. This job is setup to be run, but the file must be updated with the username and password for Traffic Ops in order to be run.  In :ref:`cdn.conf` the following fields can be defined in order to alter the number of days in advance to renew and send a summary email after renewal.

.. note:: In order for this to work, the AuthType field for the certificate must match the ACME provider in the :ref:`cdn.conf`.

.. important:: After the automatic renewal script has run, a queue and snapshot must be run manually in order for the certificates to be used.

Suggested Way of Setting up an HTTPS Delivery Service With Let's Encrypt Automation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assuming you have already created a :term:`Delivery Service` which you plan to modify to use HTTPS, do the following in Traffic Portal:

#. Select one of '1 - HTTPS', '2 - HTTP AND HTTPS', or '3 - HTTP TO HTTPS' for the protocol field of a :term:`Delivery Service` and click the :guilabel:`Update` button
#. Go to :menuselection:`More --> Manage SSL Keys`
#. Click on :menuselection:`More --> Generate SSL Keys`
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Use Let's Encrypt` slider, click on the green :guilabel:`Generate Keys` button, then confirm that you want to make these changes
#. Take a new CDN :term:`Snapshot`

Once this is done you should be able to verify that you are being correctly redirected by Traffic Router using e.g. :manpage:`curl(1)` commands to HTTPS destinations on your :term:`Delivery Service`.


Suggested Way of Setting up an HTTPS Delivery Service With Certificate Authority
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assuming you have already created a :term:`Delivery Service` which you plan to modify to use HTTPS, do the following in Traffic Portal:

#. Select one of '1 - HTTPS', '2 - HTTP AND HTTPS', or '3 - HTTP TO HTTPS' for the protocol field of a :term:`Delivery Service` and click the :guilabel:`Update` button
#. Go to :menuselection:`More --> Manage SSL Keys`
#. Click on :menuselection:`More --> Generate SSL Keys`
#. Fill out the form and click on the green :guilabel:`Generate Keys` button, then confirm that you want to make these changes
#. Copy the contents of the Certificate Signing Request field and save it locally
#. Go back and select 'HTTP' for the protocol field of the :term:`Delivery Service` and click :guilabel:`Save` (to avoid preventing other CDN :term:`Snapshot` updates from being blocked by Traffic Router)
#. Follow your standard procedure for obtaining your signed certificate chain from a :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)`
#. After receiving your certificate chain import it into Traffic Ops
#. Edit the :term:`Delivery Service`
#. Restore your original choice for the protocol field and click :guilabel:`Save`
#. Click :menuselection:`More --> Manage SSL Keys`
#. Paste your key information into the appropriate fields
#. Click the green :guilabel:`Update Keys` button
#. Take a new CDN :term:`Snapshot`

Once this is done you should be able to verify that you are being correctly redirected by Traffic Router using e.g. :manpage:`curl(1)` commands to HTTPS destinations on your :term:`Delivery Service`.

Router Load Testing
===================
The Traffic Router load testing tool is located in the `Traffic Control repository under test/router <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/tree/master/test/router>`_. It can be used to simulate a mix of HTTP and HTTPS traffic for a CDN by choosing the number of HTTP :term:`Delivery Services` and the number HTTPS :term:`Delivery Service` the test will exercise.

There are 2 parts to the load test:

* A web server that makes the actual requests and takes commands to fetch data from the CDN, start the test, and return current results.
* A web page that's used to run the test and see the results.

Running the Load Tests
----------------------
#. First, clone the `Traffic Control repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol>`_.
#. You will need to make sure you have a :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file on your machine
#. The web server is a Go program, set your ``GOPATH`` environment variable appropriately (we suggest ``$HOME/go`` or ``$HOME/src``)
#. Open a terminal emulator and navigate to the ``test/router/server`` directory inside of the cloned repository
#. Execute the server binary by running ``go run server.go``
#. Using your web browser of choice, open the file ``test/router/index.html``
#. Authenticate against a Traffic Ops host - this should be a nearly instantaneous operation - you can watch the output from ``server.go`` for feedback
#. Enter the Traffic Ops host in the second form and click the button to get a list of CDN's
#. Wait for the web page to show a list of CDN's under the above form, this may take several seconds
#. The List of CDN's will display the number of HTTP- and HTTPS-capable :term:`Delivery Services` that may be exercised
#. Choose the CDN you want to exercise from the drop-down menu
#. Fill out the rest of the form, enter appropriate numbers for each HTTP and HTTPS :term:`Delivery Services`
#. Click :guilabel:`Run Test`
#. As the test runs the web page will occasionally report results including running time, latency, and throughput

Tuning Recommendations
======================
The following is an example of the command line parameters set in :file:`/opt/traffic_router/conf/startup.properties` that has been tested on a multi-core server running under HTTPS load test requests. This is following the general recommendation to use the G1 garbage collector for :abbr:`JVM (Java Virtual Machine)` applications running on multi-core machines. In addition to using the G1 garbage collector the ``InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent`` was lowered to run garbage collection more frequently which improved overall throughput for Traffic Router and reduced 'Stop the World' garbage collection. Note that any environment variable settings in this file will override those set in :file:`/lib/systemd/system/traffic_router.service`.
