***************************
Configure Multi-Site Origin
***************************

The following steps will take you through the procedure of setting up an :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)`.
#. Create :term:`Cache Groups` for the origin locations, and assign the appropriate parent-child relationship between the Mid-tier :term:`Cache Group`\ (s) and origin :term:`Cache Groups`. Each Mid-tier :term:`Cache Group` can be assigned a primary and secondary origin parent :term:`Cache Group`. When the :term:`Cache Group` parent configuration is generated, origins in the primary :term:`Cache Groups` will be listed first, followed by origins in the secondary :term:`Cache Group`. Origin servers assigned to the :term:`Delivery Service` that are assigned to neither the primary nor secondary :term:`Cache Groups` will be listed last.

#. Create a profile to assign to each of the origins:

#. Create server entries for the origination vips:

#. Check the multi-site check box in the :term:`Delivery Service` screen:

#. Assign the org servers to the :term:`Delivery Service` that will have the multi site feature. Origin servers assigned to a :term:`Delivery Service` with multi-site checked will be assigned to be the origin servers for this :term:`Delivery Service`.

	.. Note:: “Origin Server Base URL” uniqueness: In order to enable Mid-tier :term:`Cache Group` to distinguish :term:`Delivery Services` by different :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)` algorithms while performing parent fail-over, it requires that :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)` for each :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)`-enabled :term:`Delivery Service` is unique. This means that the :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)` of an :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)`-enabled :term:`Delivery Service` should be different from the :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)`\ s of any other :term:`Delivery Service`, regardless of whether they are :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)`-enabled or not. The exceptions to this rule are:

		- If there are multiple CDNs created on the same Traffic Ops, :term:`Delivery Services` across different CDNs may have the same :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)` configured.
		- If several :term:`Delivery Services` in the same CDN have the same :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)` algorithm configured, they may share the same :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)`.
		- If delivery services are assigned with different Mid-tier :term:`Cache Groups` respectively, they can share the same :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)`.
		- This :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)` must be valid - :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` will perform a DNS lookup on this :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` even if IPs, not DNS, are used in the :file:`parent.config`.
		- The :abbr:`OSBU (Origin Server Base URL)` entered as the "Origin Server Base URL" will be sent to the origins as a host header. All origins must be configured to respond to this host.

#. Create a delivery service profile. This must be done to set the :abbr:`MSO (Multi-Site Origin)` algorithm. Also, as of :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 6.x, multi-site options must be set as parameters within the :file:`parent.config`. Header rewrite parameters will be ignored. See `ATS parent.config <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/6.2.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_ for more details. These :term:`Parameters` are now handled by the creation of a :term:`Delivery Service` :term:`Profile`.

	a) Create a :term:`Profile` of the :ref:`profile-type` ``DS_PROFILE`` for the :term:`Delivery Service` in question.

	#) In the :term:`Delivery Service` page, select the newly created ``DS_PROFILE`` and save the :term:`Delivery Service`.

#. Turn on parent_proxy_routing in the MID :term:`Profile`.

.. Note:: Support for multisite configurations with single-layer CDNs is now available. If a :term:`Cache Groups` defined parents are either blank or of the type ``ORG_LOC``, that :term:`cache server`'s ``parent.config`` will be generated as a top layer cache, even if it is an edge. In the past, ``parent.config`` generation was strictly determined by cache type. The new method examines the parent :term:`Cache Group` definitions and generates the :file:`parent.config` accordingly.
