*****************
Delivery Services
*****************
"Delivery Services" are a very important construct in :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)`. At their most basic, they are a source of content and a set of :term:`cache servers` and configuration options used to distribute that content.

Delivery Services are modeled several times over, in the Traffic Ops database, in Traffic Portal forms and tables, and several times for various :ref:`to-api` versions in the new Go Traffic Ops codebase. Go-specific data structures can be found in `the project's GoDoc documentation <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/lib/go-tc#DeliveryServiceV5>`_. Rather than application-specific definitions, what follows is an attempt at consolidating all of the different properties and names of properties of Delivery Service objects throughout the :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` suite. The names of these fields are typically chosen as the most human-readable and/or most commonly-used names for the fields, and when reading please note that in many cases these names will appear camelCased or snake_cased to be machine-readable. Any aliases of these fields that are not merely case transformations of the indicated, canonical names will be noted in a table of aliases.

.. seealso:: The API reference for Delivery Service-related endpoints such as :ref:`to-api-deliveryservices` contains definitions of the Delivery Service object(s) returned and/or accepted by those endpoints.
.. seealso:: :ref:`delivery-service-requests`

.. _ds-active:

Active
------
Whether or not this Delivery Service is active on the CDN and can be served. A Delivery Service's "active state" can be one of the three values listed below.

ACTIVE
	The Delivery Service's configuration is deployed to the appropriate :term:`cache servers` when updates are :term:`Queue`\ d, and Traffic Router is made aware of its existence through CDN :term:`Snapshots`.
PRIMED
	The Delivery Service's configuration is deployed to the appropriate :term:`cache servers` when updates are :term:`Queue`\ d, but Traffic Router is *not* made aware of its existence through CDN :term:`Snapshots`, so clients will not be routed for it.
INACTIVE
	The Delivery Service's configuration is *not* deployed to any :term:`cache servers` when updates are :term:`Queue`\ d, *nor* is Traffic Router made aware of its existence through CDN :term:`Snapshots`.

Changing a Delivery Service's "active state" either to or from "ACTIVE" will require that a new :term:`Snapshot` be taken. Likewise, a :term:`Queue Updates` must be performed if the "active state" changes either to or from "INACTIVE". Table :numref:`tbl-active-state-transitions` expresses these relationships exhaustively.

.. _tbl-active-state-transitions:

.. versionchanged:: ATCv7.1
	In API version 5, introduced in :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` version 7.1 (tentative plan for release at the time of this writing), this was switched to the enumerated strings listed here. Prior to version 5 of :ref:`to-api`, this was a boolean having only the states "true" and "false". "True" was identical to today's "ACTIVE", while "false" was identical to "PRIMED". "INACTIVE" has no legacy analogue. Thus when requesting older API versions, an "active state" of "false" may actually be either INACTIVE or PRIMED, and there is no way to tell which.

.. _ds-anonymous-blocking:

Anonymous Blocking
------------------
Enables/Disables blocking of anonymized IP address - proxies, :abbr:`TOR (The Onion Ring)` exit nodes, etc - for this Delivery Service. Set to true to enable blocking of anonymous IPs for this Delivery Service.

.. note:: Anonymous Blocking requires an anonymous IP address database from the Delivery Service's Geolocation Provider. E.g. `MaxMind's Anonymous IP Database <https://www.maxmind.com/en/solutions/geoip2-enterprise-product-suite/anonymous-ip-database>`_ when MaxMind is used as the Geolocation Provider.

.. seealso:: The :ref:`anonymous_blocking-qht` "Quick-How-To" guide.

.. _ds-cacheurl:

Cache URL Expression
--------------------
.. deprecated:: 3.0
	This feature is no longer supported by :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` and consequently it will be removed from Traffic Control in the future. Current plans are to remove after ATC 5.X is no longer supported.

Manipulates the cache key of the incoming requests. Normally, the cache key is the :term:`Origin` domain. This can be changed so that multiple services can share a cache key, can also be used to preserve cached content if service origin is changed.

.. warning:: This field provides access to a feature that was only present in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 6.X and earlier. As :term:`cache servers` must now use :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 7.1.X, this field **must** be blank unless all :term:`cache servers` can be guaranteed to use that older :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` version (**NOT** recommended).

.. _ds-cdn:

CDN
---
A CDN to which this Delivery Service belongs. Only :term:`cache servers` within this CDN are available to route content for this Delivery Service. Additionally, only Traffic Routers assigned to this CDN will perform said routing. Most often ``cdn``/``CDN`` refers to the *name* of the CDN to which the Delivery Service belongs, but occasionally (most notably in the payloads and/or query parameters of certain :ref:`to-api` endpoints) it actually refers to the *integral, unique identifier* of said CDN.

.. _ds-check-path:

Check Path
----------
A request path on the :term:`origin server` which is used to by certain :ref:`Traffic Ops Extensions <admin-to-ext-script>` to indicate the "health" of the :term:`Origin`.

.. _ds-consistent-hashing-regex:

Consistent Hashing Regular Expression
-------------------------------------
When Traffic Router performs :ref:`consistent-hashing` on a client request to find an :term:`Edge-tier cache server` to which to redirect them, it can optionally first modify the request path by extracting the pieces that match this regular expression.

.. seealso:: :ref:`pattern-based-consistenthash`

.. _ds-consistent-hashing-qparams:

Consistent Hashing Query Parameters
-----------------------------------
When Traffic Router performs :ref:`consistent-hashing` on a client request to find an :term:`Edge-tier cache server` to which to redirect them, it can optionally take into account any number of query parameters. This field defines them, formally as a Set but often represented as an Array/List due to encoding limitations. That is, if the Consistent Hashing Query Parameters on a Delivery Service are ``{test}`` and a client makes a request for ``/?test=something`` they will be directed to a different :term:`cache server` than a different client that requests ``/?test=somethingElse``, but the *same* :term:`cache server` as a client that requests ``/?test=something&quest=somethingToo``.

.. _ds-deep-caching:

Deep Caching
------------
Controls the :ref:`deep-cache` feature of Traffic Router when serving content for this Delivery Service. This should always be represented by one of two values:

ALWAYS
	This Delivery Service will always use :ref:`deep-cache`
NEVER
	This Delivery Service will never use :ref:`deep-cache`

.. impl-detail:: Traffic Ops and Traffic Ops client Go code use an empty string as the name of the enumeration member that represents "NEVER".

.. _ds-display-name:

Display Name
------------
The "name" of the Delivery Service. Since nearly any use of a string-based identification method for Delivery Services (e.g. in Traffic Portal tables) uses xml_id_, this is of limited use. For that reason and for consistency's sake it is suggested that this be the same as the xml_id_. However, unlike the xml_id_, this can contain any UTF-8 characters without restriction.

.. _ds-dns-bypass-cname:

DNS Bypass CNAME
----------------
When the limits placed on this Delivery Service by the `Global Max Mbps`_ and/or `Global Max Tps`_ are exceeded, a DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service will direct excess traffic to the host referred to by this :abbr:`CNAME (Canonical Name)` record.

.. note:: IPv6 traffic will be redirected if and only if `IPv6 Routing Enabled`_ is "true" for this Delivery Service.

.. _ds-dns-bypass-ip:

DNS Bypass IP
-------------
When the limits placed on this Delivery Service by the `Global Max Mbps`_ and/or `Global Max Tps`_ are exceeded, a DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service will direct excess IPv4 traffic to this IPv4 address.

.. _ds-dns-bypass-ipv6:

DNS Bypass IPv6
---------------
When the limits placed on this Delivery Service by the `Global Max Mbps`_ and/or `Global Max Tps`_ are exceeded, a DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service will direct excess IPv6 traffic to this IPv6 address.

.. note:: This requires an accompanying configuration of `IPv6 Routing Enabled`_ such that IPv6 traffic is allowed at all.

.. _ds-dns-bypass-ttl:

DNS Bypass TTL
--------------
When the limits placed on this Delivery Service by the `Global Max Mbps`_ and/or `Global Max Tps`_ are exceeded, a DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service will direct excess traffic to their `DNS Bypass IP`_, `DNS Bypass IPv6`_, or `DNS Bypass CNAME`_.

.. _ds-dns-ttl:

DNS TTL
-------
The :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` on the DNS record for the Traffic Router A and AAAA records. DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Services will send this :abbr:`TTL (Time To Live)` along with their record responses to clients requesting access to this Delivery Service. Setting too high or too low will result in poor caching performance.

.. _ds-dscp:

DSCP
----
The :abbr:`DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)` which will be used to mark IP packets as they are sent out of the CDN to the client.

.. seealso:: `The Differentiated Services Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services>`_.

.. warning:: The :abbr:`DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)` setting in Traffic Portal is *only* for setting traffic towards the client, and gets applied *after* the initial TCP handshake is complete and the HTTP request has been received. Before that the cache can't determine what Delivery Service is being requested, and consequently can't know what :abbr:`DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)` to apply. Therefore, the :abbr:`DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)` feature can not be used for security settings; the IP packets that form the TCP handshake are not going to be :abbr:`DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point)`-marked.

.. impl-detail:: DSCP settings only apply on :term:`cache servers` that run :abbr:`Apache Traffic Server`. The implementation uses the `ATS Header Rewrite Plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.html>`_ to create a rule that will mark traffic bound outward from the CDN to the client.

.. _ds-edge-header-rw-rules:

Edge Header Rewrite Rules
-------------------------
This field in general contains the contents of the a configuration file used by the `ATS Header Rewrite Plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.html>`_ when serving content for this Delivery Service - on :term:`Edge-tier cache servers`.

.. tip:: Because this ultimately is the contents of an :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` configuration file, it can make use of the :ref:`t3c-special-strings`.

.. note:: This field cannot be used if the Delivery Service is assigned to a :term:`Topology`.

.. _ds-ecs:

EDNS0 Client Subnet Enabled
---------------------------
A boolean value that controls whether or not EDNS0 client subnet is enabled on this Delivery Service by Traffic Router. When creating a Delivery Service in Traffic Portal, this will default to "false".

.. _ds-example-urls:

Example URLs
------------
The Example URLs of a Delivery Service are the scheme/host specifications that clients can use to request content through it. These are determined by Traffic Ops from the Delivery Service's configuration, and are read-only in virtually every context. The only reason a Delivery Service should ever have no Example URLs is if it is an ANY_MAP-`Type`_ Delivery Service (since they are not routed). For example, a Delivery Service that can deliver HTTP and HTTPS content, has a `Routing Name`_ of "cdn", an `xml_id`_ of "demo1", and belonging to a `CDN`_ that is authoritative for the `mycdn.ciab.test` domain would have two Example URLs:

- `https://cdn.demo1.mycdn.ciab.test`
- `http://cdn.demo1.mycdn.ciab.test`

Note that these are irrespective of request path; meaning a client can request e.g. `https://cdn.demo1.mycdn.ciab.test/index.html` through this Delivery Service.

.. _ds-fqpr:

Fair-Queuing Pacing Rate Bps
----------------------------
The maximum bytes per second a :term:`cache server` will deliver on any single TCP connection. This uses the Linux kernel’s Fair-Queuing :manpage:`setsockopt(2)` (``SO_MAX_PACING_RATE``) to limit the rate of delivery. Traffic exceeding this speed will only be rate-limited and not diverted. This option requires extra configuration on all :term:`cache servers` assigned to this Delivery Service - specifically, the line ``net.core.default_qdisc = fq`` must exist in :file:`/etc/sysctl.conf`.

.. seealso:: :manpage:`tc-fq_codel(8)`

First Header Rewrite Rules
--------------------------
This field in general contains the contents of the a configuration file used by the `ATS Header Rewrite Plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.html>`_ when serving content for this Delivery Service - on :term:`First-tier cache servers`.

.. tip:: Because this ultimately is the contents of an :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` configuration file, it can make use of the :ref:`t3c-special-strings`.

.. note:: This field can only be used if the Delivery Service is assigned to a :term:`Topology`.

.. _ds-geo-limit:

Geo Limit
---------
Limits access to a Delivery Service by geographic location. The only practical difference between this and `Regional Geoblocking`_ is the configuration method; as opposed to `Regional Geoblocking`_, GeoLimit configuration is handled by country-wide codes and the :term:`Coverage Zone File`. When a client is denied access to a requested resource on an HTTP-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service, they will receive a ``503 Service Unavailable`` instead of the usual ``302 Found`` response - unless `Geo Limit Redirect URL`_ is defined, in which case a ``302 Found`` response pointing to that URL will be returned by Traffic Router. If the Delivery Service is a DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Service, the IP address of the *resolver* for the client DNS request is what is checked. If the IP address of this resolver is found to be in a restricted location, the Traffic Router will respond with an ``NXDOMAIN`` response, causing the name resolution to fail. This is nearly always an integral, unique identifier for a behavior set to be followed by Traffic Router. The defined values are:

0
	Geographic access limiting is not enabled, and content served by this Delivery Service will be accessible regardless of the clients geographic location. (Aliased as "0 - None" in Traffic Portal forms)
1
	A client will be allowed to request content if and only if their IP address is found by Traffic Router within the :term:`Coverage Zone File`. Otherwise, access will be denied. (Aliased as "1 - CZF Only" in Traffic Portal forms)
2
	A client will be allowed to request content if their IP address is found by Traffic Router within the :term:`Coverage Zone File`, or if looking up the client's IP address in the Geographic IP mapping database provided by `Geolocation Provider`_ indicates the client resides in a country that is found in the `Geo Limit Countries`_ array. (Aliased as "2 - CZF + Country Code(s)" in Traffic Portal forms - formerly was known as "CZF + US" when only the US country code was supported)

.. warning:: The definitions of each integral, unique identifier are hidden in implementations in each :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` component. Different components will handle invalid values differently, and there's no actual enforcement that the stored integral, unique identifier actually be within the representable range.

.. danger:: Geographic access limiting is **not** sufficient to guarantee access is properly restricted. The limiting is implemented by Traffic Router, which means that direct requests to :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` will bypass it entirely.

.. _ds-geo-limit-countries:

Geo Limit Countries
-------------------
When `Geo Limit`_ is being used with this Delivery Service (and is set to exactly ``2``), this is optionally a list of country codes to which access to content provided by the Delivery Service will be restricted. Normally, this is an array of strings representing country codes, but in legacy versions of the :ref:`to-api` it was a comma-delimited string of said country codes rather than a real array. When creating or modifying this field of a Delivery Service in said legacy API versions, any amount of whitespace between country codes is permissible, as it will be removed on submission, but responses from the :ref:`to-api` should never include such whitespace.

.. _ds-geo-limit-redirect-url:

Geo Limit Redirect URL
----------------------
If `Geo Limit`_ is being used with this Delivery Service, this is optionally a URL to which clients will be redirected when Traffic Router determines that they are not in a geographic zone that permits their access to the Delivery Service content. This changes the response from Traffic Router from ``503 Service Unavailable`` to ``302 Found`` with a provided location that will be this URL. There is no restriction on the provided URL; it may even be the path to a resource served by this Delivery Service. In fact, this field need not even be a full URL, it can be a relative path. Both of these cases are handled specially by Traffic Router.

- If the provided URL is a resource served by the Delivery Service (e.g. if the client requests ``http://cdn.dsXMLID.somedomain.example.com/index.html`` but are denied access by `Geo Limit`_ and the Geo Limit Redirect URL is something like ``http://cdn.dsXMLID.somedomain.example.com/help.php``), Traffic Router will find an appropriate :term:`Edge-tier cache server` and redirect the client, ignoring Geo Limit restrictions *for this request only*.
- If the provided "URL" is actually a relative path, it will be considered *relative to the requested Delivery Service* :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`. This means that e.g. if the client requests ``http://cdn.dsXMLID.somedomain.example.com/index.html`` but are denied access by `Geo Limit`_ and the Geo Limit Redirect URL is something like ``/help.php``, Traffic Router will find an appropriate :term:`Edge-tier cache server` and redirect the client to it as though they had requested ``http://cdn.dsXMLID.somedomain.example.com/help.php``, ignoring `Geo Limit`_ restrictions *for this request only*.

.. note:: The use of a redirect URL relies on the ability of Traffic Router to redirect the client using HTTP ``302 Found`` responses. As such, this field has no effect on DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Services.

.. _ds-geo-provider:

Geolocation Provider
--------------------
This is nearly always the integral, unique identifier of a provider for a database that maps IP addresses to geographic locations. Less frequently, this may be accompanied by the actual name of the provider. Only two values are possible at the time of this writing:

0: MaxMind
	IP address to geographic location mapping will be provided by a `MaxMind GeoIP2 database <https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases>`_.
1: Neustar
	IP address to geographic location mapping will be provided by a `Neustar GeoPoint IP address database <https://www.security.neustar/digital-performance/ip-intelligence/ip-address-data>`_.

	.. warning:: It's not clear whether Neustar databases are actually supported; this is an old option and compatibility may have been broken over time.

.. _ds-ipv6-routing:

IPv6 Routing Enabled
--------------------
A boolean value that controls whether or not clients using IPv6 can be routed to this Delivery Service by Traffic Router. When creating a Delivery Service in Traffic Portal, this will default to "true".

.. _ds-info-url:

Info URL
--------
This should be a URL (though neither the :ref:`to-api` nor the Traffic Ops Database in any way enforce the validity of said URL) to which administrators or others may refer for further information regarding a Delivery Service - e.g. a related JIRA ticket.

.. _ds-initial-dispersion:

Initial Dispersion
------------------
The number of :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` across which a particular asset will be distributed within each :term:`Cache Group`. For most use-cases, this should be 1, meaning that all clients requesting a particular asset will be directed to 1 :term:`cache server` per :term:`Cache Group`. Depending on the popularity and size of assets, consider increasing this number in order to spread the request load across more than 1 :term:`cache server`. The larger this number, the more copies of a particular asset are stored in a :term:`Cache Group`, which can "pollute" caches (if load distribution is unnecessary) and decreases caching efficiency (due to cache misses if the asset is not requested enough to stay "fresh" in all the caches).

.. _ds-inner-header-rw-rules:

.. _ds-logs-enabled:

Logs Enabled
------------
A boolean switch that can be toggled to enable/disable logging for a Delivery Service.

.. note:: This doesn't actually do anything. It was part of the functionality for a planned Traffic Control component named "Traffic Logs" - which was never created.

.. _ds-matchlist:

Match List
----------
A Match List is a set of regular expressions used by Traffic Router to determine whether a given request from a client should be served by this Delivery Service. Under normal circumstances this field should only ever be read-only as its contents should be generated by Traffic Ops based on the Delivery Service's configuration. These regular expressions can each be one of the following types:

HEADER_REGEXP
	This Delivery Service will be used if an HTTP Header/Value pair can be found in the clients request matching this regular expression.\ [#httpOnlyRegex]_
HOST_REGEXP
	This Delivery Service will be used if the requested host matches this regular expression. The host can be found using the ``Host`` HTTP Header, or as the requested name in a DNS request, depending on the `Type`_ of the Delivery Service.
PATH_REGEXP
	This Delivery Service will be used if the request path matches this regular expression.\ [#httpOnlyRegex]_

.. _ds-steering-regexp:

STEERING_REGEXP
	This Delivery Service will be used if this regular expression matches the xml_id_ of one of this Delivery Service's "targets"

		.. note:: This regular expression type can only exist in the Match List of STEERING-`Type`_ Delivery Services - and **not** CLIENT_STEERING.

.. _ds-max-dns-answers:

Max DNS Answers
---------------

DNS-routed Delivery Service
	The maximum number of :term:`Edge-tier cache server` IP addresses that the Traffic Router will include in responses to DNS requests. When provided, the :term:`cache server` IP addresses included are rotated in each response to spread traffic evenly. This number should scale according to the amount of traffic the Delivery Service is expected to serve.

HTTP-routed Delivery Service
	If the Traffic Router profile parameter "edge.http.limit" is set, setting this to a non-zero value will override that parameter for this delivery service, limiting the number of Traffic Router IP addresses (A records) that are included in responses to DNS requests for this delivery service.

.. _ds-max-origin-connections:

Max Origin Connections
----------------------
The maximum number of TCP connections individual :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` are allowed to make to the `Origin Server Base URL`. A value of ``0`` in this field indicates that there is no maximum.


.. note:: Max Origin Connections can be made per-:ref:`Cache Group <cache-groups>` by setting the :ref:`ds-regional` field.

------------------------
The maximum size(in bytes) of the request header that is allowed for this Delivery Service.

.. _ds-mid-header-rw-rules:

This field in general contains the contents of the a configuration file used by the `ATS Header Rewrite Plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/header_rewrite.en.html>`_ when serving content for this Delivery Service - on :term:`Mid-tier cache servers`.

.. tip:: Because this ultimately is the contents of an :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` configuration file, it can make use of the :ref:`t3c-special-strings`.

.. note:: This field cannot be used if the Delivery Service is assigned to a :term:`Topology`.

.. _ds-origin-url:

Origin Server Base URL

.. _ds-protocol:

Protocol
--------
The protocol with which to serve content from this Delivery Service. This defines the way the Delivery Service will handle client requests that are either HTTP or HTTPS, which is distinct from what protocols are used to direct traffic. For example, this can be used to direct clients to only request content using HTTP, or to allow clients to use either HTTP or HTTPS, etc. Normally, this will be the name of the protocol handling, but occasionally this will appear as the integral, unique identifier of the protocol handling instead. The integral, unique identifiers and their associated names and meanings are:

0: HTTP
	This Delivery Service will only accept unsecured HTTP requests. Requests made with HTTPS will fail.
1: HTTPS
	This Delivery Service will only accept secured HTTPS requests. Requests made with HTTP will fail.
2: HTTP AND HTTPS
	This Delivery Service will accept both unsecured HTTP requests and secured HTTPS requests.
3: HTTP TO HTTPS
	When this Delivery Service is using HTTP :ref:`Content Routing <ds-types>` unsecured HTTP requests will be met with a response that indicates to the client that further requests must use HTTPS.

	.. note:: If any other type of :ref:`Content Routing <ds-types>` is used, this functionality cannot be used. In those cases, a protocol setting of ``3``/"HTTP TO HTTPS" will result in the same behavior as ``1``/"HTTPS". This behavior is tracked by `GitHub Issue #3221 <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/3221>`_


.. warning:: The definitions of each integral, unique identifier are hidden in implementations in each :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` component. Different components will handle invalid values differently, and there's no actual enforcement that the stored integral, unique identifier actually be within the representable range.

.. _ds-qstring-handling:

Query String Handling
---------------------
Describes how query strings should be handled by the :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` when serving content for this Delivery Service. This is nearly always expressed as an integral, unique identifier for each behavior, though in Traffic Portal a more descriptive value is typically used, or at least provided in addition to the integral, unique identifier. The allowed values and their meanings are:

0
	For the purposes of caching, :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` will consider URLs unique if and only if they are unique up to and including any and all query parameters. They will also pass the query parameters in their own requests to :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` (which in turn will exhibit the same caching behavior and pass the query parameters in requests to the :term:`Origin`). (Aliased as "USE" in Traffic Portal tables, and "0 - use qstring in cache key, and pass up" in Traffic Portal forms)
1
	For the purposes of caching, neither :term:`Edge-tier` nor :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` will consider the query parameter string when determining if a URL is stored in cache. However, the query string will still be passed in upstream requests to :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` and in turn the :term:`Origin`. (Aliased as "IGNORE" in Traffic Portal tables and "1 - ignore in cache key, and pass up" in Traffic Portal forms)
2
	The query parameter string will be stripped from URLs immediately when the request is received by an :term:`Edge-tier cache server`. This means it is never considered for the purposes of caching unique URLs and will not be passed in upstream requests. (Aliased as "DROP" in Traffic Portal tables and "2 - drop at edge" in Traffic Portal forms)

	.. warning:: The implementation of dropping query parameter strings at the :term:`Edge-tier` uses a `Regex Remap Expression`_ and thus Delivery Services with this type of query string handling cannot make use of `Regex Remap Expression`_\ s.

The Delivery Service's Query String Handling can be set directly as a field on the Delivery Service object itself, or it can be overridden by a :term:`Parameter` on a Profile_ used by this Delivery Service. The special :term:`Parameter` named ``psel.qstring_handling`` and configuration file ``parent.config`` will have it's contents directly inserted into the ``parent.config`` file on all :term:`cache servers` assigned to this Delivery Service.

.. danger:: Using the ``psel.qstring_handling`` :term:`Parameter` is **strongly** discouraged for several reasons. Firstly, at a Delivery Service level it will **NOT** change the configuration of that Delivery Service's own Query String Handling - which will cause it to appear in Traffic Portal and in :ref:`to-api` responses as though it were configured one way while actually behaving a different way altogether. Also, no validation is performed on the value given to it. Because it's inserted verbatim into the ``qstring`` field of a line in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` `parent.config configuration file <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_, a typo or an ignorant user can easily cause :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` instances on all :term:`cache servers` assigned to that Delivery Service to fail to reload their configuration, possibly grinding entire CDNs to a halt.


.. seealso:: When implemented as a :term:`Parameter` (``psel.qstring_handling``), its value must be a valid value for the ``qstring`` field of a line in the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` ``parent.config`` configuration file. For a description of valid values, see the `documentation for parent.config <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_

.. _ds-range-request-handling:

Range Request Handling
----------------------
Describes how HTTP "Range Requests" should be handled by the Delivery Service at the :term:`Edge-tier`. This is nearly always an integral, unique identifier for the behavior set required of the :term:`Edge-tier cache servers`. The valid values and their respective meanings are:

0
	Do not cache Range Requests at all. (Aliased as "0 - Don't cache" in Traffic Portal forms)

		.. note:: This is not retroactive - when modifying an existing Delivery Services to have this value for "Range Request Handling", ranges requested from files that are already cached due to a non-range request will be served out of cache for as long as the Cache-Control headers allow.

1
	Use the `background_fetch <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/background_fetch.en.html>`_ plugin to service the range request while caching the whole object. (Aliased as "1 - Use background_fetch plugin" in Traffic Portal forms)
2
	Use the `cache_range_requests <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/7.1.x/plugins/experimental/cache_range_requests>`_ plugin to cache ranges as unique objects. (Aliased as "2 - Use cache_range_requests plugin" in Traffic Portal forms)
3
	Use the `slice <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/master/plugins/experimental/slice>`_ plugin to slice range based requests into deterministic chunks. (Aliased as "3 - Use slice plugin" in Traffic Portal forms)

		.. versionadded:: ATCv4.1

.. note:: Range Request Handling can only be implemented on :term:`cache servers` using :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` because of its dependence on :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` plugins. The value may be set on any Delivery Service, but will have no effect when the :term:`cache servers` that ultimately end up serving the content are e.g. Grove, Nginx, etc.

.. warning:: The definitions of each integral, unique identifier are hidden in implementations in each :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` component. Different components will handle invalid values differently, and there's no actual enforcement that the stored integral, unique identifier actually be within the representable range.

.. _ds-slice-block-size:

Range Slice Request Block Size
------------------------------
The block size in bytes that is used for `slice <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/tree/master/plugins/experimental/slice>`_ plugin.

This can only and must be set if the :ref:`ds-range-request-handling` is set to ``3``.

.. _ds-raw-remap:

Raw Remap Text
--------------
For HTTP and DNS-:ref:`Routed <ds-types>` Delivery Services, this will be added to the end of a line in the `remap.config ATS configuration file <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/remap.config.en.html>`_ line on the cache verbatim. For ANY_MAP-:ref:`Type <ds-types>` Delivery Services this must be defined.

.. tip:: Because this ultimately is a raw line of content in a configuration file, it can make use of the :ref:`t3c-special-strings`. Of particular note is the :ref:`t3c-remap-override` template string.

.. note:: This field **must** be defined on ANY_MAP-`Type`_ Delivery Services, but is otherwise optional.

Directives
"""

The Raw Remap text is ordinarily added at the end of the line, after everything else. However, it may be necessary to change the normal arg ordering, especially if the user needs to modify the cachekey, range headers or URI in a way that may change cachekey or regex_remap behaviors.

It may be necessary to add Range Request Handling after the Raw Remap. For example, if you have a plugin which manipulates the Range header. In this case, you can insert the text ``__RANGE_DIRECTIVE__`` in the Raw Remap text, and the range request handling directives will be added at that point.

For example, if you have an Apache Traffic Server lua plugin which manipulates the range, and are using Slice Range Request Handling which needs to run after your plugin, you can set a Raw Remap, ``@plugin=tslua.so @pparam=range.lua __RANGE_DIRECTIVE__``, and the ``@plugin=slice.so`` range directive will be inserted after your plugin.

Another example might be a Delivery Service which modifies the uri in a way that changes the cachey key (cachekey), and affects parent routing (regex_remap) with the possibility of range request handling via background fetch.  Raw Remap Text might then look like: ``@plugin=tslua.so @pparam=uri-manip.lua __CACHEKEY_DIRECTIVE__ __REGEX_REMAP_DIRECTIVE__ __RANGE_DIRECTIVE__``.  This would set things up such that background_fetch would issue a request to the proper remap parent.

.. _ds-regex-remap:

Regex Remap Expression
----------------------
Allows remapping of incoming requests URL using regular expressions to search and replace text. In a more literal sense, this is the raw contents of a configuration file used by the `ATS regex_remap plugin  <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/regex_remap.en.html>`_. At its most basic, the contents of this field should consist of ``map`` followed by a regular expression and then a "template URL" - all space-separated. The regular expression matches a client's request *path* (i.e. not a full URL - ``/path/to/content`` **not** ``https://origin.example.com/path/to/content``) and when such a match occurs, the request is transformed into a request for the template URL. The most basic usage of the template URL is to use ``$1``-``$9`` to insert the corresponding regular expression capture group. For example, a regular expression of :regexp:`^/a/(.*)` and a template URL of ``https://origin.example.com/b/$1`` maps requests for :term:`Origin` content under path ``/a/`` to the same sub-paths under path ``b``. Note that since it's a full URL, this mapping can be made to another server entirely.

.. seealso:: The `documentation for the regex_remap plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/regex_remap.en.html>`_ for :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)`

.. caution:: This field is not validated by Traffic Ops to be correct syntactically, and can cause Traffic Server to not start if invalid. Please use with caution.

.. warning:: Regex remap expressions are incompatible with `Query String Handling`_ being set to ``2``. The behavior of a :term:`cache server` under that configuration is undefined.

	.. tip:: It is, of course, entirely possible to write a Regex Remap Expression that reproduces the desired `Query String Handling`_ as well as any other desired behavior.

.. _ds-regional:

Regional
--------
A boolean value. If a Delivery Service is Regional (``true``), then :ref:`ds-max-origin-connections` is per :ref:`Cache Group <cache-groups>`, rather than divided over all :term:`Cache Servers` in child Cache Groups of the :term:`Origin` (``false``, the default).

.. _ds-regionalgeo:

Regional Geoblocking
--------------------
A boolean value that defines whether or not :ref:`Regional Geoblocking <regionalgeo-qht>` is active on this Delivery Service. The actual configuration of :ref:`Regional Geoblocking <regionalgeo-qht>` is done in the :term:`Profile` used by the Traffic Router serving the Delivery Service. Rules for this Delivery Service may exist, but they will not actually be used unless this field is ``true``.

.. tip:: :ref:`Regional Geoblocking <regionalgeo-qht>` is configured primarily with respect to Canadian postal codes, so unless specifically Canadian regions should be allowed/disallowed to access content, `Geo Limit`_ is probably a better setting for controlling access to content according to geographic location.

.. _ds-required-capabilities:

Required Capabilities
---------------------
.. versionadded:: ATCv4

A Delivery Service can be associated with :term:`Server Capabilities` that it requires :term:`cache servers` serving its content to have. When one or more :term:`Server Capability` is required by a Delivery Service, it will block the assignment of :term:`cache servers` to it that do not have those :term:`Server Capabilities`. Additionally, the :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` assigned to a Delivery Service that requires a :term:`Server Capability` will only request content they do not have cached from :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` which also have this :term:`Server Capability`.

Typically, a required :term:`Server Capability` is represented merely by the name of said :term:`Server Capability`. In fact, there's nothing more to a :term:`Server Capability` than its name; it's the responsibility of CDN operators to ensure that they are assigned and required properly. There is no mechanism to detect whether or not a :term:`cache server` has a given :term:`Server Capability`, it must be assigned manually.

.. _ds-routing-name:

Routing Name
------------
A DNS label in the Delivery Service's domain that forms the :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` that is used by clients to request content. All together, the constructed :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` looks like: :file:`{Delivery Service Routing Name}.{Delivery Service xml_id}.{CDN Subdomain}.{CDN Domain}.{Top-Level Domain}`\ [#xmlValid]_.

.. _ds-servers:

Servers
-------
Servers can be assigned to Delivery Services using the :ref:`tp-configure-servers` and :ref:`tp-services-delivery-service` Traffic Portal sections, or by directly using the :ref:`to-api-deliveryserviceserver` endpoint. Only :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` can be assigned to a Delivery Service, and once they are so assigned they will begin to serve content for the Delivery Service (after updates are queued and then applied). Any servers assigned to a Delivery Service must also belong to the same CDN_ as the Delivery Service itself. At least one server must be assigned to a Delivery Service in order for it to serve any content.

.. _ds-service-category:

Service Category
----------------
A service category is a tag that describes the type of content being delivered by the Delivery Service. Some example values are: "Linear" and "VOD"

.. _ds-signing-algorithm:

Signing Algorithm
-----------------
URLs/URIs may be signed using one of two algorithms before a request for the content to which they refer is sent to the :term:`Origin` (which in practice can be any upstream network). At the time of this writing, this field is restricted within the Traffic Ops Database to one of two values (or ``NULL``/"None", to indicate no signing should be done).

.. seealso:: The url_sig `README <https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/blob/master/plugins/experimental/url_sig/README>`_.

.. seealso:: `The draft RFC for uri_signing <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-uri-signing-16>`_ - note, however that the current implementation of uri_signing uses Draft 12 of that RFC document, **NOT** the latest.

url_sig
	URL signing will be implemented in this Delivery Service using the `url_sig Apache Traffic Server plugin <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/plugins/url_sig.en.html>`_. (Aliased as "URL Signature Keys" in Traffic Portal forms)

Keys for either algorithm can be generated within :ref:`Traffic Portal <tp-services-delivery-service>`.

.. _ds-ssl-key-version:

SSL Key Version
---------------
An integer that describes the version of the SSL key(s) - if any - used by this Delivery Service. This is incremented whenever Traffic Portal generates new SSL keys for the Delivery Service.

.. warning:: This number will not be correct if keys are manually replaced using the API, as the key generation API does not increment it!

.. _ds-static-dns-entries:

Static DNS Entries
------------------
Static DNS Entries can be added *under* a Delivery Service's domain. These DNS records can be configured in the :ref:`tp-services-delivery-service` section of Traffic Portal, and can be any valid CNAME, A or AAAA DNS record - provided the associated hostname falls within the DNS domain for the Delivery Service. For example, a Delivery Service with xml_id_ "demo1" and belonging to a CDN_ with domain "mycdn.ciab.test" could have Static DNS Entries for hostnames "foo.demo1.mycdn.ciab.test" or "foo.bar.demo1.mycdn.ciab.test" but not "foo.bar.mycdn.ciab.test" or "foo.bar.test".

.. note:: The `Routing Name`_ of a Delivery Service is not part of the :abbr:`SOA (Start of Authority)` record for the Delivery Service's domain, and so there is no need to place Static DNS Entries below a domain containing it.

.. _ds-tenant:

Tenant
------
The :term:`Tenant` who owns this Delivery Service. They (and their parents, if any) are the only ones allowed to make changes to this Delivery Service. Typically, ``tenant``/``Tenant`` refers to the *name* of the owning :term:`Tenant`, but occasionally (most notably in the payloads and/or query parameters of certain :ref:`to-api` requests) it actually refers to the *integral, unique identifier* of said :term:`Tenant`.

.. _ds-tls-versions:

TLS Versions
------------
The versions of TLS that can be used in HTTP requests to :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` for this Delivery Service's content can be limited using this property. When a Delivery Service has this property set to anything other than a ``null`` value, it lists the versions that will be allowed. Any versions can be added to the supported set, so long as they are of the form :samp:`{Major}.{Minor}`, e.g. ``1.1`` or ``42.0``. When this is a ``null`` value, no restrictions are placed on the TLS versions that may be used for retrieving Delivery Service content.

.. impl-detail:: Traffic Ops will accept empty arrays as a synonym for ``null`` in requests, but will always represent them as ``null`` in responses. Note that this means it's impossible to create a Delivery Service that explicitly supports no TLS versions - the proper way to disable HTTPS for a Delivery Service is to set its Protocol_ accordingly.

A Delivery Service that has a Type_ of ``STEERING`` or ``CLIENT_STEERING`` may not legally be set to have a TLS Versions property that is non-``null``.

.. warning:: Using this setting may cause old clients that only support archaic TLS versions to break suddenly. Be sure that the security increase is worth this risk.

.. _ds-topology:

Topology
--------
A structure composed of :term:`Cache Groups` and parent relationships, which is assignable to one or more :term:`Delivery Services`.

.. _ds-tr-resp-headers:

.. _ds-types:

Type
----
Defines the content routing method used by the Delivery Service. In most cases this is an integral, unique identifier that corresponds to an enumeration of the Delivery Service Types. In other cases, this the actual name of said type.

The "Type" of a Delivery Service can mean several things. First, it can be used to refer to the "routing type" of Delivery Service. This is one of:

.. tip:: The only way to get the integral, unique identifier of a :term:`Type` of Delivery Service is to look at the database after it has been generated; these are non-deterministic and cannot be guaranteed to have any particular value, or even consistent values. This can be done directly or, preferably, using the :ref:`to-api-types` endpoint. Unfortunately, knowing the name of the :term:`Type` is rarely enough for many applications. The ``useInColumn`` values of these :term:`Types` will be ``deliveryservice``.

DNS
	Delivery Services of this routing type are routed by Traffic Router by providing DNS records that provide the IP addresses of :term:`cache servers` when clients look up the full Delivery Service :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`.
HTTP
	The Traffic Router(s) responsible for routing this Delivery Service will still answer DNS requests for the Delivery Service :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`, but will provide its own IP address. The client then directs its HTTP request to the Traffic Router, which will use an `HTTP redirection response <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#Redirection_messages>`_ to direct the client to a :term:`cache server`.

More generally, though, Delivery Services have a Type that defines not only how traffic is routed, but also how content is cached and semantically defines what "content" means in the context of a given Delivery Service.

ANY_MAP
	This is a special kind of Delivery Service that should only be used when control over the clients is guaranteed, and very fine control over the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` `remap.config  <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/remap.config.en.html>`_ line for this Delivery Service is required. ANY_MAP is not known to Traffic Router. It is not routed in any way. For Delivery Services of this type, the "Raw Remap Text" field **must** be defined, as it is the only configuration generated by Traffic Control. The only way for a client to utilize delivery through an ANY_MAP service is by knowing in advance the IP address of one or more :term:`Edge-tier cache servers` and make the appropriate request(s).
DNS
	Uses DNS content routing. Delivers content normally. This is the recommended Type for delivering smaller objects like web page images.
DNS_LIVE\ [#dupOrigin]_
	Uses DNS Content routing, but optimizes caching for live video streaming. Specifically, the configuration generated for :term:`cache servers` responsible for serving content for this Delivery Service will not cache that content on storage disks. Instead, they will make use of RAM block devices dedicated to ATS - as specified by the special ``RAM_Drive_Prefix`` and ``RAM_Drive_Letters`` :term:`Parameters`. Also, any :term:`Mid-tier` of caching is bypassed.
DNS_LIVE_NATNL
	Works exactly the same as DNS_LIVE, but is optimized for delivery of live video content across a wide physical area. What this means is that the :term:`Mid-tier` of caching is **not** bypassed, unlike DNS_LIVE. The :term:`Mid-tier` will also use block RAM devices.
HTTP
	Uses HTTP content routing, delivers content normally. This is the recommended Type for delivering larger objects like video streams.
HTTP_LIVE\ [#dupOrigin]_
	Uses HTTP Content routing, but optimizes caching for live video streaming. Specifically, the configuration generated for :term:`cache servers` responsible for serving content for this Delivery Service will not cache that content on storage disks. Instead, they will make use of RAM block devices dedicated to ATS - as specified by the special ``RAM_Drive_Prefix`` and ``RAM_Drive_Letters`` :term:`Parameters`. Also, any :term:`Mid-tier` of caching is bypassed.
HTTP_LIVE_NATNL
	Works exactly the same as HTTP_LIVE, but is optimized for delivery of live video content across a wide physical area. What this means is that the :term:`Mid-tier` of caching is **not** bypassed, unlike HTTP_LIVE. The :term:`Mid-tier` will also use block RAM devices.
HTTP_NO_CACHE\ [#dupOrigin]_
	Uses HTTP Content Routing, but :term:`cache servers` will not actually cache the delivered content - they act as just proxies. This will bypass any existing :term:`Mid-tier` entirely (as it's totally useless when content is not being cached).

.. _ds-steering:

STEERING
	This is a sort of "meta" Delivery Service. It is used for directing clients to one of a set of Delivery Services, rather than delivering content directly itself. The Delivery Services to which a STEERING Delivery Service routes clients are referred to as "targets". Targets in general have an associated "value" and can be of several :term:`Types` that define the meaning of the value - these being:

.. _ds-steering-order:

	STEERING_ORDER
		The value of a STEERING_ORDER target sets a strict order of preference. In cases where a response to a client contains multiple Delivery Services, those targets with a lower "value" appear earlier than those with a higher "value". In cases where two or more targets share the same value, they each have an equal chance of being presented to the client - effectively spreading traffic evenly across them.

.. _ds-steering-weight:

	STEERING_WEIGHT
		The values of STEERING_WEIGHT targets are interpreted as "weights", which define how likely it is that any given client will be routed to a specific Delivery Service - effectively this determines the spread of traffic across each target.

	The targets of a Delivery Service may be set using :ref:`the appropriate section of Traffic Portal <tp-services-delivery-service>` or via the :ref:`to-api-steering-id-targets` and :ref:`to-api-steering-id-targets-targetID` :ref:`to-api` endpoints.

	.. seealso:: For more information on setting up a STEERING (or CLIENT_STEERING) Delivery Service, see :ref:`steering-qht`.

	.. seealso:: For implementation details about how Traffic Router routes STEERING (and CLIENT_STEERING) Delivery Services, see :ref:`tr-steering`.

.. _ds-client-steering:

CLIENT_STEERING
	A CLIENT_STEERING Delivery Service is exactly like STEERING except that it provides clients with methods of bypassing the weights, orders, and localizations of targets in order to choose any arbitrary target at will. When utilizing these methods, the client will either directly choose a target immediately or request a list of all available targets from Traffic Router and then choose one to which to send a subsequent request for actual content. CLIENT_STEERING also supports two additional target types:

	STEERING_GEO_ORDER
		These targets behave exactly like STEERING_ORDER targets, but Delivery Services are grouped according to the "locations" of their :term:`Origins`. Before choosing a Delivery Service to which to direct the client, Traffic Router will first create subsets of choices according to these groupings, and order them by physical distance from the client (closest to farthest). Within these subsets, the values of the targets establish a strict precedence ordering, just like STEERING_ORDER targets.
	STEERING_GEO_WEIGHT
		These targets behave exactly like STEERING_WEIGHT targets, but Delivery Services are grouped according to the "locations" of their :term:`Origins`. Before choosing a Delivery Service to which to direct the client, Traffic Router will first create subsets of choices according to these groupings, and order them by physical distance from the client (closest to farthest). Within these subsets, the values of the targets establish the likelihood that any given target within the subset will be chosen for the client - effectively determining the spread of traffic across targets within that subset.

	.. important:: To make use of the STEERING_GEO_ORDER and/or STEERING_GEO_WEIGHT target types, it is first necessary to ensure that at least the "primary" :term:`Origin` of the :term:`Delivery Service` has an associated geographic coordinate pair. This can be done either from the :ref:`tp-configure-origins` page in Traffic Portal, or using the :ref:`to-api-origins` :ref:`to-api` endpoint.

.. note:: "Steering" is also commonly used to collectively refer to either of the kinds of Delivery Services that can participate in steering behavior (STEERING and CLIENT_STEERING).

.. _ds-multi-site-origin:

Use Multi-Site Origin Feature
-----------------------------
A boolean value that indicates whether or not this Delivery Service serves content for an :term:`Origin` that provides content from two or more redundant servers. There are very few good reasons for this to not be ``false``. When ``true``, Traffic Ops will configure :term:`Mid-tier cache servers` to perform load-balancing and other optimizations for redundant :term:`origin servers`.

Naturally, this assumes that each redundant server is exactly identical, from request paths to actual content. If Multi-Site Origin is configured for servers that are *not* identical, the client's experience is undefined. Furthermore, the :term:`origin servers` may have differing IP addresses, but **must** serve content for a single :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)` - as defined by the Delivery Service's `Origin Server Base URL`_. These redundant servers **must** be configured as servers (server :term:`Type` ``ORG``) in Traffic Ops - either using the :ref:`appropriate section of Traffic Portal <tp-configure-servers>` or the :ref:`to-api-servers` endpoint.

.. important:: In order for a given :term:`Mid-tier cache server` to support Multi-Site Origins, the value of a :term:`Parameter` named ``http.parent_proxy_routing_enable`` in configuration file ``records.config`` must be set to ``1`` on that server's :term:`Profile`. If using an optional secondary grouping of Multi-Site Origins, the :term:`Parameter` named ``url_remap.remap_required`` in configuration file ``records.config`` must also be set to ``1`` on that :term:`Profile`. These settings must be applied to all :term:`Mid-tier cache servers`' that are the :term:`parents` of any :term:`Edge-tier cache server` assigned to this Delivery Service.

	.. seealso:: These parameters are described in the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` documentation sections for `Parent Proxy Configuration <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html#proxy-config-http-parent-proxy-routing-enable>`_ and `URL Remap Rules <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html#proxy-config-url-remap-remap-required>`_, respectively.

This string will become a part of the CDN service domain, which all together looks like: :file:`{Delivery Service Routing Name}.{Delivery Service xml_id}.{CDN Subdomain}.{CDN Domain}.{Top-Level Domain}`.

.. _ds-parameters:

Delivery Service Parameters
---------------------------
Features which are new, experimental, or not significant enough to be first-class Delivery Service fields are often added as :term:`Parameters`. To use these, add a :term:`Profile` to the Delivery Service, with the given :term:`Parameter` assigned.

.. _ds-parameters-parent.config:

parent.config
"""""""""""""
The following :term:`Parameters` must have the :ref:`Config File <parameter-config-file>` ``parent.config`` to take effect - even if, strictly speaking, they aren't used to modify the contents of the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` ``parent.config`` configuration file.

.. seealso:: See the `Apache Traffic Server documentation for parent.config <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/9.1.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_ and `their documentation for strategies.yaml <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/9.1.x/admin-guide/files/strategies.yaml.en.html>`_ for more information on its implementation of parent selection (and in particular Multi-Site Origins).


- ``try_all_primaries_before_secondary`` - on a Delivery Service :term:`Profile`, if this exists, try all "primary parents" before "failing over" to "secondary parents", which may be ideal if objects are unlikely to be in cache. The default behavior is to immediately fail to a secondary, which is ideal if objects are likely to be in cache, as the first consistent-hashed "secondary parent" will be the "primary parent" in its own :term:`Cache Group` and therefore receive requests for that object from clients near its own :term:`Cache Group`.

	.. caution:: The :ref:`parameter-value` of this :term:`Parameter` is ignored. It is considered implicitly "truthy" if the :term:`Parameter` is present at all on the Profile_. This means that the :ref:`Values <parameter-value>` ``false``, ``0``, and ``"no"`` will all result in the behavior described being adopted, contrary to what might be intuitively expected.

- ``enable_h2`` - On a Delivery Service Profile, if the :ref:`parameter-value` of this :term:`Parameter` begins with ``t`` or ``y`` (case-insensitive), HTTP/2 is enabled for client requests. :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` must also be listening for HTTP/2 - configured in ``records.config`` - or this will have no effect.

	.. impl-detail:: This :term:`Parameter` does not affect the contents of ``parent.config``, but instead either ``ssl_server_name.yaml`` in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 8 or ``sni.yaml`` in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 9. It has the ``parent.config`` :ref:`parameter-config-file` value for consistency.

	.. warning:: Interpretation of the :ref:`parameter-value` of this :term:`Parameter` is extremely permissive. For example, the :ref:`Values <parameter-value>` ``t``, ``Y``, ``True``, ``yes``, ``talse``, ``yno``, ``Yeah, don't do this``, ``You should never under any circumstances allow HTTP/2``, and ``totally horrible idea to enable this`` all equally mean "true". No part of :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` checks or warns about typos or strange :ref:`Values <parameter-value>` for this :term:`Parameter`, so take care to prevent typos, misspellings, and the like to avoid confusing situations.

- ``tls_versions`` - on a Delivery Service :term:`Profile`, if this exists, enable the given comma-delimited\ [#tlsDelimiters]_ TLS versions for client requests e.g. ``1.1,1.2,1.3``. :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` must also be accepting those TLS versions - configured in ``records.config`` - or this will have no effect.

	.. impl-detail:: This :term:`Parameter` does not affect the contents of ``parent.config``, but instead either ``ssl_server_name.yaml`` in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 8 or ``sni.yaml`` in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 9. It has the ``parent.config`` :ref:`parameter-config-file` value for consistency.

	.. caution:: The actual permitted TLS versions are the union of those laid out in this :term:`Parameter` and those configured as the `TLS Versions`_ property of the Delivery Service.

- ``use_peering`` - on a Deliver Service :term:`Profile`, if this exists and is ``true``, the ``strategy ring_mode`` will be set to ``peering_ring`` for large library DNS support.

	.. impl-detail:: This :term:`Parameter` does not affect the contents of ``parent.config``, but instead ``strategies.yaml`` in :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` 9. It has the ``parent.config`` :ref:`parameter-config-file` value for consistency.

- ``merge_parent_groups`` - on a Deliver Service :term:`Profile`, if this exists, moves each of the space-separated :term:`Cache Groups` named in the :ref:`parameter-value` from the secondary parent list into the primary parent list. This can be used to combine all parents into a single consistent hash ring.

	.. deprecated:: ATCv6.2
		In :ref:`to-api` version 4, TLS versions should be configured using the `TLS Versions`_ property of the Delivery Service, and support for this :term:`Parameter` will be removed at some point after the stabilization of :ref:`to-api` version 4.

Parameters that Affect Multi-Site Origin and Parent Down Behavior

The above :term:`Parameters` are supported for ``first``, ``inner`` and ``last`` tiers by specifying prefixes ``first.``, ``inner.`` and ``last.``, applicable to both topology and non topology. This allows fine tuning of marking parents "down" and retry behavior inside a CDN.

.. deprecated:: The ``mso.`` prefix is deprecated.  ``last.`` prefix should be preferred although no prefix can also be used.

.. warning:: The `simple_retry_response_codes`` :term:`Parameter` has no apparent, possible use according to the :abbr:`ATS (Apache Traffic Server)` `parent.config documentation <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/9.1.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_. Whether or not it has any effect - let alone the *intended* effect - is not known, and its use is therefore strongly discouraged.

.. seealso:: To see how the :ref:`Values <parameter-value>` of these Parameters are interpreted, refer to the `Apache Traffic Server documentation on the parent.config configuration file <https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/7.1.x/admin-guide/files/parent.config.en.html>`_

.. [#xmlValid] Some things to consider when choosing an xml_id and routing name: the name should be descriptive and unique, but as brief as possible to avoid creating a monstrous :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`. Also, because these are combined to form an :abbr:`FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)`, they should not contain any characters that are illegal for a DNS subdomain, e.g. ``.`` (period/dot). Finally, the restrictions on what characters are allowable (especially in xml_id) are, in general, **NOT** enforced by the :ref:`to-api`, so take care that the name is appropriate. See :rfc:`1035` for exact guidelines.
