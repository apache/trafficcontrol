Delivery Service Requests
*************************
A :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` is a request to create a new :term:`Delivery Service`, delete an existing :term:`Delivery Service`, or modify an existing :term:`Delivery Service`. The model for a :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` is, therefore, somewhat nebulous as it depends on the model of a :term:`Delivery Service`. This concept is not to be confused with :ref:`to-api-v3-deliveryservices-request`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`ds_requests` for information about how to use :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)`\ s in

.. seealso:: The API reference for Delivery Service-related endpoints such as :ref:`to-api-deliveryservice-requests` contains definitions of the Delivery Service object(s) returned and/or accepted by those endpoints.

.. seealso:: The :atc-godoc:`lib/go-tc.DeliveryServiceRequestV30` Go structure documentation.

The model for a :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` in the most recent version of the :ref:`to-api` is given in :ref:`dsr-interface` as a Typescript interface.

.. _dsr-interface:

delete
	An existing :term:`Delivery Service` will be deleted
update
	An existing :term:`Delivery Service` will be modified

----------
This is the date and time at which the :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was created. In the context of the :ref:`to-api`, it is formatted as an :rfc:`3339` date string except where otherwise noted.

ID
--
An integral, unique identifier for the :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)`.

Last Edited By
--------------
This is the username of the user by whom the :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was last edited.

Original
--------
If this property of a :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` exists, then it represents the original :term:`Delivery Service` before the :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was/would have been/is fulfilled. This property only exists on :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)`\ s that have a `Change Type`_ of "update" or "delete". This is a full representation of a :term:`Delivery Service`, and so in the context of :ref:`to-api` has the same structure as a request to or response from the :ref:`to-api-deliveryservices` endpoint, as appropriate for its `Change Type`_.

Requested
---------
If this property of a :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` exists, then it is represents the :term:`Delivery Service` the creator wishes to exist - possibly in place of an existing :term:`Delivery Service` that shares its identifying properties. This property only exists on :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)`\ s that have a `Change Type`_ of "update" or "create". This is a full representation of a :term:`Delivery Service`, and so in the context of :ref:`to-api` has the same structure as a request to or response from the :ref:`to-api-deliveryservices` endpoint, as appropriate for its `Change Type`_.

.. _dsr-status:

Status
------
Status is a string that indicates the point in the :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` workflow lifecycle at which a given :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` is. Generally a :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` may be either "open" - meaning that it is available to be modified, reviewed, and possibly either completed or rejected - or "closed" - meaning that it has been completed or rejected. More specifically, "open" :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)`\ s have one of the following Statuses:

draft
	The :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` is not yet ready for completion or review that might result in rejection, as it is still being actively worked on.
submitted
	The :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` has been submitted for review, but has not yet been reviewed.

... while a "closed" :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` has one of these Statuses:

complete
	The :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was approved and its declared action was taken.
pending
	The :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was approved and the changes are applied, but the new configuration is not yet disseminated to other :abbr:`ATC (Apache Traffic Control)` components - usually meaning that it cannot be considered truly complete until a :term:`Snapshot` is taken or a :term:`Queue Updates` performed.
rejected
	The :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` was rejected and closed; it cannot be completed.

A "closed" :abbr:`DSR (Delivery Service Request)` cannot be edited - except to change a "pending" Status to "complete" or "rejected".
