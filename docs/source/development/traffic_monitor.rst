Introduction
============
Traffic Monitor is a Java Tomcat application that monitors caches, provides health state information to Traffic Router, and collects statistics for use in tools such as Traffic Ops and Traffic Stats.  The health state provided by Traffic Monitor is used by Traffic Router to control which caches are available on the CDN.

To work on Traffic Monitor you need a \*nix (MacOS and Linux are most commonly used) environment that has the following installed:

* Eclipse >= Kepler SR2 (or another Java IDE)
* Maven >= 3.3.1
* JDK >= 6.0

* ``traffic_control/traffic_monitor/`` - base directory for Traffic Monitor

	* ``etc/`` - Miscellaneous simulator utilities
	* ``src/main`` - Main source directory for the Traffic Monitor

		* ``bin/`` - Configuration tools
		* ``conf/`` - Configuration files
		* ``java/`` - Java source code for Traffic Monitor
		* ``opt/tomcat/conf`` - Contains Tomcat configuration file(s) pulled in during an RPM build
		* ``resources/`` - Resources pulled in during an RPM build

		* ``java/`` - JUnit based unit tests for Traffic Monitor
		* ``resources/conf`` - Configuration files used by unit tests
		* ``resources/db`` - Files downloaded by unit tests
		* ``resources/var`` - Files generated by unit tests

Java Formatting Conventions 
===========================
None at this time.  The codebase will eventually be formatted per Java standards.

Installing The Developer Environment
====================================
To install the Traffic Monitor Developer environment:

1. Clone the traffic_control repository using Git.
2. Change directories into ``traffic_control/traffic_monitor``.
3. Edit the following parameters in src/test/resources/conf/traffic_monitor_config.js:

+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Parameter    |                           Value                            |
+=================+============================================================+
| ``tm.hostname`` | FQDN of the Traffic Ops instance (do not include http://). |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``tm.username`` | Admin username for Traffic Ops                             |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``tm.password`` | Password for admin user                                    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``cdnName``     | Name of the CDN this Traffic Monitor will monitor          |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

4. Import the existing git repo into Eclipse:

	a. File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git; Next
	b. Existing local repository; Next
	c. Add -> browse to find ``traffic_control``; Add
	d. Select ``traffic_control``; Next
	e. Ensure "Import existing projects" is selected, expand ``traffic_control``, select ``traffic_monitor``; Next
	f. Ensure ``traffic_monitor`` is checked; Finish
	g. Ensure ``traffic_monitor`` has been opened by Eclipse after importing

5. Run ``mvn clean verify`` from the ``traffic_monitor`` directory

6. Start the embedded Jetty instance from within Eclipse

	a. In the package explorer, expand ``traffic_monitor``
	b. Expand ``src/test/java``
	c. Expand the package ``com.comcast.cdn.traffic_control.traffic_monitor``
	d. Open and run ``Start.java``

		..  Note:: If an error is displayed in the Console, run ``mvn clean verify`` from the ``traffic_monitor`` directory

	e. With a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080

Test Cases
==========
Unit tests can be executed using Maven by running ``mvn test`` at the root of the ``traffic_monitor`` project.
