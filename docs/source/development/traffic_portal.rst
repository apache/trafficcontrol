Traffic Portal Project Tree Overview
=====================================
* **traffic_control/traffic_portal/app/src** - contains HTML, JavaScript and :abbr:`SCSS (Sassy CSS)` source files.

Installing The Traffic Portal Developer Environment
===================================================
#. Clone the `Traffic Control Repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol>`_
#. Navigate to the ``traffic_portal`` subdirectory of your cloned repository.
#. Run ``npm install`` to install application dependencies into ``traffic_portal/node_modules``. Only needs to be done the first time unless ``traffic_portal/package.json`` changes.

#. Modify :atc-file:`traffic_portal/conf/configDev.js`:

	#. Valid SSL certificates and keys are needed for Traffic Portal to run. Generate these (e.g. using `this SuperUser answer <https://superuser.com/questions/226192/avoid-password-prompt-for-keys-and-prompts-for-dn-information#answer-226229>`_) and update ``ssl``.
	#. Modify ``api.base_url`` to point to your Traffic Ops API endpoint.

#. Run ``grunt`` to package the application into ``traffic_portal/app/dist``, start a local HTTPS server (Express), and start a file watcher. To use a custom configuration file (not just :atc-file:`traffic_portal/conf/config.js` or :atc-file:`traffic_portal/conf/configDev.js`), set the `TP_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to the location of the desired file.
#. Navigate to http(s)://localhost:[port|sslPort defined in the configuration file used (default: :atc-file:`traffic_portal/conf/configDev.js`)]
