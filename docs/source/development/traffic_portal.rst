Introduction
============
Traffic Portal is an `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ client served from a `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ web server designed to consume the :ref:`to-api`. Traffic Portal is the official replacement for the legacy Traffic Ops UI.

.. _dev-tp-software-requirements:

Software Requirements
=====================
To work on Traffic Portal you need a \*nix (MacOS and Linux are most commonly used) environment that has the following installed:

	* `Ruby Devel 2.0.x or above <https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=ruby-devel>`_
	* `Compass 1.0.x or above <http://compass-style.org/>`_
	* `Node.js 12.0.x or above <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_
	* `Bower 1.7.9 or above <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower>`_
	* `Grunt CLI 1.2.0 or above <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli>`_
	* Access to a working instance of Traffic Ops

Install Global NPM Packages
---------------------------

Bower and the Grunt CLI can be installed using NPM.

.. code-block:: shell
	:caption: Install Bower and Grunt CLI

	npm -g install bower grunt-cli

.. _dev-tp-compass:

Install Compass
---------------

Compass can be installed using ``gem`` manually, or by using ``bundle``

.. tip:: Bundle will automatically install the correct version of the gems.

#. ``brew install ruby``/``apt-get install ruby``/``yum install ruby``

#. ``gem update --system``

#. At this point, you can either manually install the gems or use bundler

	#. For manually: ``gem install sass compass``

	#. For automatically: ``gem install bundle && bundle install``

	.. note:: Bundle requires ruby versions > 2.3.0, so if you're using a version of ruby < 2.3.0 then this will not work.

#. Make sure that ``compass`` and ``sass`` are part of your ``PATH`` environment variable.

#. If not, you can see where gem installs ``compass`` and ``sass`` by running:
	``gem environment``

#. In there, you can see where ruby is installing all the gems. Add that path to your ``PATH`` environment variable.
	For example, it is ``/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/compass-1.0.3/bin/`` for this test setup.

#. Once you have installed ``compass`` successfully, make sure you can reach it by typing:
	``compass version``
	This should give a valid output. For example, for the test setup, the output is:

Traffic Portal Project Tree Overview
=====================================
* **traffic_control/traffic_portal/app/src** - contains HTML, JavaScript and :abbr:`SCSS (Sassy CSS)` source files.

Installing The Traffic Portal Developer Environment
===================================================
#. Clone the `Traffic Control Repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol>`_
#. Navigate to the ``traffic_portal`` subdirectory of your cloned repository.
#. Run ``npm install`` to install application dependencies into ``traffic_portal/node_modules``. Only needs to be done the first time unless ``traffic_portal/package.json`` changes.
#. Run ``bower install`` to install client-side dependencies into ``traffic_portal/app/bower_components``. Only needs to be done the first time unless ``traffic_portal/bower.json`` changes.
#. Make sure that compass is installed and functioning correctly by running ``compass version``. If compass is not available, then it can be installed following the instructions under :ref:`dev-tp-compass`.

#. Run ``grunt`` to package the application into ``traffic_portal/app/dist``, start a local HTTPS server (Express), and start a file watcher.
#. Modify ``traffic_portal/conf/config.js``:

	#. Valid SSL certificates and keys are needed for Traffic Portal to run. Generate these (e.g. using `this SuperUser answer <https://superuser.com/questions/226192/avoid-password-prompt-for-keys-and-prompts-for-dn-information#answer-226229>`_) and update ``ssl``.
	#. Modify ``api.base_url`` to point to your Traffic Ops API endpoint.
	#. Modify ``files.static`` to be ``./app/dist/public``.
	#. Modify ``log.stream`` to be ``./server/log/access.log``. If you have created a ``traffic_portal/log`` directory with ``access.log`` file, use that location.
    #. Ensure ca_bundle.crt is present at ``/etc/pki/tls/certs``. If not present, use the cmd: ``sudo touch ca_bundle.crt``
#. Navigate to http(s)://localhost:[port|sslPort defined in ``traffic_portal/conf/config.js``]

.. note:: The Traffic Portal consumes the Traffic Ops API. Modify traffic_portal/conf/config.js to specify the location of Traffic Ops.
