# An init.d script for running a Node.js process as a service using Forever as
# the process monitor. For more configuration options associated with Forever,
# see: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever
#
# This was written for Debian distributions such as Ubuntu, but should still
# work on RedHat, Fedora, or other RPM-based distributions, since none of the
# built-in service functions are used. So information is provided for both.

    # utility.
    #
    # The minUptime and spinSleepTime settings stop Forever from thrashing if
    # the application fails immediately on launch. This is generally necessary to
    # avoid loading development servers to the point of failure every time
    # someone makes an error in application initialization code, or bringing down
    # production servers the same way if a database or other critical service
    # suddenly becomes inaccessible.

    # to make this script work if provisioning the service via Chef.
