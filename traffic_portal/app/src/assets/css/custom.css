    This file is a placeholder for custom styles for Traffic Portal. To customize styles, create your own custom.css and copy it
    to /resources/assets/css/ on your web server replacing the old, blank one. This file should remain blank in source control.
    If the default bootstrap styles are sufficient, do nothing.
