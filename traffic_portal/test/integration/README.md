# Traffic Portal Test Automation
This directory contains integration tests for Traffic Portal.

## Prerequisites
* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v12 or later.

## Building and Running
To build and run the tests, one can use the `npm` (or `pnpm`) scripts.

* Install the dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`)
* Run the webdriver, either in the background or in a separate terminal -
	because it's a long-running process - with `npm run start-webdriver` (or
	`pnpm run start-webdriver`)
* Run the tests with `npm test` (or `pnpm test`)

## Command Line Parameters
The tests can accept a few command line parameters - which can be separated
from the `npm` flags with `--`.

| Flag                            | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| params.baseUrl                  | Environment test run on. Tests are written for cdn-in-a-box only. Do not run on other environment                                   |
| capabilities.shardTestFiles     | Input `true` or `false` to turn on or off parallelization. If the value is false, maxInstances will always count as 1. The default value in the config file = false                            |
| capabilities.maxInstances       | Input number of Chromium instances that your machine can handle. Test will fail if local machine cannot handle a lot of Chromium instances. The default value = 1    |

### Example
```bash
npm test -- --params.baseUrl https://localhost --capabilities.shardTestFiles true
```
