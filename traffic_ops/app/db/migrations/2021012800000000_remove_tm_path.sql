/*
This migration removes the 'tm_path' property from the 'stats' property of the
'crconfig' column of stored CDN Snapshots, if it exists.

When reverted, it will insert (if possible) a 'tm_path' value of
/api/4.0/cdns/{{CDN Name}}/snapshot
where 'CDN Name' is the name of the CDN snapshotted as determined by the
Snapshot data - NOT the linked CDN object. This is so it does not self-confilct
afterward regarding which CDN is named, even if the one to which it is linked
is wrong, somehow.
