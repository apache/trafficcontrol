Traffic Ops is the tool for administration (configuration and monitoring) of all components in a Traffic Control CDN. The CDN administrator uses Traffic Ops to manage servers, cache groups, delivery services, etc. In many cases, a configuration change requires propagation to several, or even all, caches and only explicitly after or before the same change propagates to Traffic Router. Traffic Ops takes care of this required consistency between the different components and their configuration. Traffic Ops exposes its data through a series of HTTP APIs and has a user interface that is interactive and viewable using a standard web browser.
