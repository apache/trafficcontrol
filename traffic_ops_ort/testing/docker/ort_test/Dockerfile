# Dockerfile to build Traffic Server container images
#   as Edges for Traffic Control 1.4
# Based on CentOS 6.6
############################################################

# For cache, you may either use (RAM or disk) block devices or disk directories
# To use RAM block devices, pass them as /dev/ram0 and /dev/ram1 via `docker run --device`
# To use disk directories, simply don't pass devices, and the container will configure Traffic Server for directories

# Block devices may be created on the native machine with, for example, `modprobe brd`.
# The recommended minimum size for each block devices is 1G.
# For example, `sudo modprobe brd rd_size=1048576 rd_nr=2`
