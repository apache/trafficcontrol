// toreqold implements a Traffic Ops client vendored one version back.
//
// This should be used for all requests, unless they require an endpoint or field added in the latest version.
//
// If a feature in the latest Traffic Ops is required, toreqnew should be used with a fallback to this client if the Traffic Ops is not the latest (which can be determined by the bool returned by all toreqnew.TOClient funcs).
