// this resets the IDs of things attached to a DS, which needs to be done
// because the WithObjs flow destroys and recreates those object IDs
// non-deterministically with each test - BUT, the client method permanently
// alters the DSR structures by adding these referential IDs. Older clients
// got away with it by not making 'DeliveryService' a pointer, but to add
// original/requested fields you need to sometimes allow each to be nil, so
// this is a problem that needs to be solved at some point.
// A better solution _might_ be to reload all the test fixtures every time
// to wipe any and all referential modifications made to any test data, but
// for now that's overkill.
