// ErrorConstant is used for error messages.
//
// Note that the ErrorConstant constants exported by this package most usually
// are values that have the same string value as an error-level Alert returned
// by the Traffic Ops API. Because those are arising from Alerts, one cannot
// actually use e.g. err == TenantUserNotAuthError or even
// errors.Is(err, TenantUserNotAuthError) to check for equivalence with these
// exported errors. Because of this, the use of these constants outside of
// Traffic Ops-internal code is discouraged, and these constants may be moved
// into that package (or a sub-package thereof) at some point in the future.
