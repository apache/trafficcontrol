## [7.0.0] - 2022-07-19
### Added
- [Traffic Portal] Added Layered Profile feature to /servers/
- [#6448](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/6448) Added `status` and `lastPoll` fields to the `publish/CrStates` endpoint of Traffic Monitor (TM).
- Added back to the health-client the `status` field logging with the addition of the filed to `publish/CrStates`
- Added a new Traffic Ops endpoint to `GET` capacity and telemetry data for CDNi integration.
- Added SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) capability to CDN-In-A-Box.
- Added a Traffic Ops endpoints to `PUT` a requested configuration change for a full configuration or per host and an endpoint to approve or deny the request.
- Traffic Monitor config option `distributed_polling` which enables the ability for Traffic Monitor to poll a subset of the CDN and divide into "local peer groups" and "distributed peer groups". Traffic Monitors in the same group are local peers, while Traffic Monitors in other groups are distributed peers. Each TM group polls the same set of cachegroups and gets availability data for the other cachegroups from other TM groups. This allows each TM to be responsible for polling a subset of the CDN while still having a full view of CDN availability. In order to use this, `stat_polling` must be disabled.
- Added support for a new Traffic Ops GLOBAL profile parameter -- `tm_query_status_override` -- to override which status of Traffic Monitors to query (default: ONLINE).
- Traffic Ops: added new `cdn.conf` option -- `user_cache_refresh_interval_sec` -- which enables an in-memory users cache to improve performance. Default: 0 (disabled).
- Traffic Ops: added new `cdn.conf` option -- `server_update_status_cache_refresh_interval_sec` -- which enables an in-memory server update status cache to improve performance. Default: 0 (disabled).
- Traffic Router: Add support for `file`-protocol URLs for the `geolocation.polling.url` for the Geolocation database.
- Replaces all Traffic Portal Tenant select boxes with a novel tree select box [#6427](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/6427).
- Traffic Monitor: Add support for `access.log` to TM.
- Added functionality for login to provide a Bearer token and for that token to be later used for authorization.
- [Traffic Portal] Added the ability for users to view Delivery Service Requests corresponding to individual Delivery Services in TP.
- [Traffic Ops] Added support for backend configurations so that Traffic Ops can act as a reverse proxy for these services [#6754](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/pull/6754).
- Added functionality for CDN locks, so that they can be shared amongst a list of specified usernames.
- [Traffic Ops | Traffic Go Clients | T3C] Add additional timestamp fields to server for queuing and dequeueing config and revalidate updates.
- Added layered profile feature to 4.0 for `GET` /servers/, `POST` /servers/, `PUT` /servers/{id} and `DELETE` /servers/{id}.
- Added a Traffic Ops endpoint and Traffic Portal page to view all CDNi configuration update requests and approve or deny.
- Added layered profile feature to 4.0 for `GET` /deliveryservices/{id}/servers/ and /deliveryservices/{id}/servers/eligible.
- Change to t3c regex_revalidate so that STALE is no longer explicitly added for default revalidate rule for ATS version backwards compatibility.
- Change to t3c diff to flag a config file for replacement if owner/group settings are not `ats` [#6879](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/6879).
- t3c now looks in the executable dir path for t3c- utilities
- Added support for parent.config markdown/retry DS parameters using first./inner./last. prefixes.  mso. and <null> prefixes should be deprecated.
- Add new __REGEX_REMAP_DIRECTIVE__ support to raw remap text to allow moving the regex_remap placement.
- t3c change `t3c diff` call to `t3c-diff` to fix a performance regression.

### Changed
- Migrated completely off of bower in favor of npm
- Updated the Traffic Ops Python client to 3.0
- Updated Flot libraries to supported versions
- [apache/trafficcontrol](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol) is now a Go module
- Updated Traffic Ops supported database version from PostgreSQL 9.6 to 13.2
- [#3342](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/3342) - Updated the [`db/admin`](https://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/traffic_ops.html#database-management) tool to use [Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) instead of Goose and converted the migrations to Migrate format (split up/down for each migration into separate files)
- Set Traffic Router to also accept TLSv1.3 protocols by default in server.xml
- Disabled TLSv1.1 for Traffic Router in Ansible role by default
- Updated the Traffic Monitor Ansible role to set `serve_write_timeout_ms` to `20000` by default because 10 seconds can be too short for relatively large CDNs.
- Refactored the Traffic Ops - Traffic Vault integration to more easily support the development of new Traffic Vault backends
- Changed the Traffic Router package structure from com.comcast.cdn.\* to org.apache.\*
- Updated Apache Tomcat from 8.5.63 to 9.0.43
- Improved the DNSSEC refresh Traffic Ops API (`/cdns/dnsseckeys/refresh`). As of TO API v4, its method is `PUT` instead of `GET`, its response format was changed to return an alert instead of a string-based response, it returns a 202 instead of a 200, and it now works with the `async_status` API in order for the client to check the status of the async job: [#3054](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/issues/3054)
- Delivery Service Requests now keep a record of the changes they make.
- Changed the `goose` provider to the maintained fork [`github.com/kevinburke/goose`](https://github.com/kevinburke/goose)
- The format of the `/servers/{{host name}}/update_status` Traffic Ops API endpoint has been changed to use a top-level `response` property, in keeping with (most of) the rest of the API.
- The API v4 Traffic Ops Go client has been overhauled compared to its predecessors to have a consistent call signature that allows passing query string parameters and HTTP headers to any client method.
- Updated BouncyCastle libraries in Traffic Router to v1.68.
- lib/go-atscfg Make funcs to take Opts, to reduce future breaking changes.
- CDN in a Box now uses `t3c` for cache configuration.
- CDN in a Box now uses Apache Traffic Server 8.1.
- Customer names in payloads sent to the `/deliveryservices/request` Traffic Ops API endpoint can no longer contain characters besides alphanumerics, @, !, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, *, (, ), [, ], '.', ' ', and '-'. This fixes a vulnerability that allowed email content injection.
- Go version 1.17 is used to compile Traffic Ops, T3C, Traffic Monitor, Traffic Stats, and Grove.

### Deprecated
- The Riak Traffic Vault backend is now deprecated and its support may be removed in a future release. It is highly recommended to use the new PostgreSQL backend instead.
- The `riak.conf` config file and its corresponding `--riakcfg` option in `traffic_ops_golang` have been deprecated. Please use `"traffic_vault_backend": "riak"` and `"traffic_vault_config"` (with the existing contents of riak.conf) instead.
- The Traffic Ops API route `GET /api/{version}/vault/bucket/{bucket}/key/{key}/values` has been deprecated and will no longer be available as of Traffic Ops API v4
- The Traffic Ops API route `POST /api/{version}/deliveryservices/request` has been deprecated and will no longer be available as of Traffic Ops API v4
- The Traffic Ops API routes `GET /api/{version}/cachegroupparameters`, `POST /api/{version}/cachegroupparameters`, `GET /api/{version}/cachegroups/{id}/parameters`, and `DELETE /api/{version}/cachegroupparameters/{cachegroupID}/{parameterId}` have been deprecated and will no longer be available as of Traffic Ops API v4
- The `riak_port` option in cdn.conf is now deprecated. Please use the `"port"` field in `traffic_vault_config` instead.
- The `traffic_ops_ort.pl` tool has been deprecated in favor of `t3c`, and will be removed in the next major version.
- With the release of ATC v6.0, major API version 2 is now deprecated, subject to removal with the next ATC major version release, at the earliest.

### Removed
- Removed the unused `backend_max_connections` option from `cdn.conf`.
- Removed the unused `http_poll_no_sleep`, `max_stat_history`, `max_health_history`, `cache_health_polling_interval_ms`, `cache_stat_polling_interval_ms`, and `peer_polling_interval_ms` Traffic Monitor config options.
- Removed the `Long Description 2` and `Long Description 3` fields of `DeliveryService` from the UI, and changed the backend so that routes corresponding API 4.0 and above no longer accept or return these fields.
- The Perl implementation of Traffic Ops has been stripped out, along with the Go implementation's "fall-back to Perl" behavior.
- Traffic Ops no longer includes an `app/public` directory, as the static webserver has been removed along with the Perl Traffic Ops implementation. Traffic Ops also no longer attempts to download MaxMind GeoIP City databases when running the Traffic Ops Postinstall script.
- The `compare` tool stack has been removed, as it no longer serves a purpose.
- Removed the Perl-only `cdn.conf` option `geniso.iso_root_path`
- t3c dispersion flags. These flags existed in ort.pl and t3c, but the feature has been removed in t3c-apply. The t3c run is fast enough now, there's no value or need in internal logic, operators can easily use shell pipelines to randomly sleep before running if necessary.
- Traffic Ops API version 1

- Added ability for Traffic Monitor to determine health of cache based on interface data and aggregate data. Using the new `stats_over_http` `health.polling.format` value that allows monitoring of multiple interfaces will first require that *all* Traffic Monitors monitoring the affected cache server be upgraded.
- Added ORT option to try all primaries before falling back to secondary parents, via Delivery Service Profile Parameter "try_all_primaries_before_secondary".

### Changed
- Changed some Traffic Ops Go Client methods to use `DeliveryServiceNullable` inputs and outputs.
- When creating invalidation jobs through TO/TP, if an identical regex is detected that overlaps its time, then warnings
will be returned indicating that overlap exists.
- Changed Traffic Portal to disable browser caching on GETs until it utilizes the If-Modified-Since functionality that the TO API now provides.
- Changed Traffic Portal to use Traffic Ops API v3
- Changed Traffic Portal to use the more performant and powerful ag-grid for all server and invalidation request tables.
- Changed ORT Config Generation to be deterministic, which will prevent spurious diffs when nothing actually changed.
- Changed ORT to find the local ATS config directory and use it when location Parameters don't exist for many required configs, including all Delivery Service files (Header Rewrites, Regex Remap, URL Sig, URI Signing).
- Changed ORT to not update ip_allow.config but log an error if it needs updating in syncds mode, and only actually update in badass mode.
    - ATS has a known bug, where reloading when ip_allow.config has changed blocks arbitrary addresses. This will break things by not allowing any new necessary servers, but prevents breaking the Mid server. There is no solution that doesn't break something, until ATS fixes the bug, and breaking an Edge is better than breaking a Mid.
- Changed the access logs in Traffic Ops to now show the route ID with every API endpoint call. The Route ID is appended to the end of the access log line.
- Changed Traffic Monitor's `tmconfig.backup` to store the result of `GET /api/2.0/cdns/{{name}}/configs/monitoring` instead of a transformed map
- Changed OAuth workflow to use Basic Auth if client secret is provided per RFC6749 section 2.3.1.
- [Multiple Interface Servers](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/blob/master/blueprints/multi-interface-servers.md)
    - Interface data is constructed from IP Address/Gateway/Netmask (and their IPv6 counterparts) and Interface Name and Interface MTU fields on services. These **MUST** have proper, valid data before attempting to upgrade or the upgrade **WILL** fail. In particular IP fields need to be valid IP addresses/netmasks, and MTU must only be positive integers of at least 1280.
    - The `/servers` and `/servers/{{ID}}}` TO API endpoints have been updated to use and reflect multi-interface servers.
    - Updated `/cdns/{{name}}/configs/monitoring` TO API endpoint to return multi-interface data.
    - CDN Snapshots now use a server's "service addresses" to provide its IP addresses.
    - Changed the `Cache States` tab of the Traffic Monitor UI to properly handle multiple interfaces.
    - Changed the `/publish/CacheStats` in Traffic Monitor to support multiple interfaces.
    - Changed the CDN-in-a-Box server enrollment template to support multiple interfaces.
- Changed Tomcat Java dependency to 8.5.57.
- Changed Spring Framework Java dependency to 4.2.5.
- Changed certificate loading code in Traffic Router to use Bouncy Castle instead of deprecated Sun libraries.
- Changed deprecated AsyncHttpClient Java dependency to use new active mirror and updated to version 2.12.1.
- Changed Traffic Portal to use the more performant and powerful ag-grid for the delivery service request (DSR) table.
- Traffic Ops: removed change log entry created during server update/revalidation unqueue
- Updated CDN in a Box to CentOS 8 and added `RHEL_VERSION` Docker build arg so CDN in a Box can be built for CentOS 7, if desired
- Added Delivery Service Raw Remap `__CACHEKEY_DIRECTIVE__` directive to allow inserting the cachekey directive into the Raw Remap text. This allows Raw Remaps which manipulate the cachekey.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated the non-nullable `DeliveryService` Go struct and other structs that use it. `DeliveryServiceNullable` structs should be used instead.
- Deprecated the `insecure` option in `traffic_ops_golang` in favor of `"tls_config": { "InsecureSkipVerify": <bool> }`
- Importing Traffic Ops Go clients via the un-versioned `github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/client` is now deprecated in favor of versioned import paths e.g. `github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/traffic_ops/v3-client`.

### Removed
- Removed deprecated Traffic Ops Go Client methods.
- Configuration generation logic in the TO API (v1) for all files and the "meta" route - this means that versions of Traffic Ops ORT earlier than 4.0.0 **will not work any longer** with versions of Traffic Ops moving forward.
- Removed from Traffic Portal the ability to view cache server config files as the contents are no longer reliable through the TO API due to the introduction of atstccfg.


## [4.1.0] - 2020-04-23
### Added
- Added support for use of ATS Slice plugin as an additonal option to range request handling on HTTP/DNS DSes.
- Added a boolean to delivery service in Traffic Portal and Traffic Ops to enable EDNS0 client subnet at the delivery service level and include it in the cr-config.
- Updated Traffic Router to read new EDSN0 client subnet field and route accordingly only for enabled delivery services. When enabled and a subnet is present in the request, the subnet appears in the `chi` field and the resolver address is in the `rhi` field.
- Traffic Router DNSSEC zone diffing: if enabled via the new "dnssec.zone.diffing.enabled" TR profile parameter, TR will diff existing zones against newly generated zones in order to determine if a zone needs to be re-signed. Zones are typically generated on every snapshot and whenever new DNSSEC keys are found, and since signing a zone is a relatively CPU-intensive operation, this optimization can drastically reduce the CPU time taken to process new snapshots and new DNSSEC keys.
- Added an optimistic quorum feature to Traffic Monitor to prevent false negative states from propagating to downstream components in the event of network isolation.
- Added the ability to fetch users by role
- Added an API 1.5 endpoint to generate delivery service certificates using Let's Encrypt
- Added an API 1.5 endpoint to GET a single or all records for Let's Encrypt DNS challenge
- Added an API 1.5 endpoint to renew certificates
- Added ability to create multiple objects from generic API Create with a single POST.
- Added debugging functionality to CDN-in-a-Box.
- Added an SMTP server to CDN-in-a-Box.
- Cached builder Docker images on Docker Hub to speed up build time
- Added functionality in the GET endpoints to support the "If-Modified-Since" header in the incoming requests.

- Modified Traffic Monitor to poll over IPv6 as well as IPv4 and separate the availability statuses.
- Modified Traffic Router to separate availability statuses between IPv4 and IPv6.
- Modified Traffic Portal and Traffic Ops to accept IPv6 only servers.
- Updated Traffic Monitor to default to polling both IPv4 and IPv6.
- Traffic Ops, Traffic Monitor, Traffic Stats, and Grove are now compiled using Go version 1.14. This requires a Traffic Vault config update (see note below).
- Existing installations **must** enable TLSv1.1 for Traffic Vault in order for Traffic Ops to reach it. See [Enabling TLS 1.1](https://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/traffic_vault.html#tv-admin-enable-tlsv1-1) in the Traffic Vault administrator's guide for instructions.
- Changed the `totalBytes` property of responses to GET requests to `/deliveryservice_stats` to the more appropriate `totalKiloBytes` in API 2.x
- Fix to traffic_ops_ort to generate logging.yaml files correctly.
- Fixed issue #4650: add the "Vary: Accept-Encoding" header to all responses from Traffic Ops

## [4.0.0] - 2019-12-16
### Added
- Traffic Router: TR now generates a self-signed certificate at startup and uses it as the default TLS cert.
  The default certificate is used whenever a client attempts an SSL handshake for an SNI host which does not match
  any of the other certificates.
- Client Steering Forced Diversity: force Traffic Router to return more unique edge caches in CLIENT_STEERING results instead of the default behavior which can sometimes return a result of multiple targets using the same edge cache. In the case of edge cache failures, this feature will give clients a chance to retry a different edge cache. This can be enabled with the new "client.steering.forced.diversity" Traffic Router profile parameter.

- Traffic Router: Added a tunable bounded queue to support DNS request processing.
- Traffic Ops API Routing Blacklist: via the `routing_blacklist` field in `cdn.conf`, enable certain whitelisted Go routes to be handled by Perl instead (via the `perl_routes` list) in case a regression is found in the Go handler, and explicitly disable any routes via the `disabled_routes` list. Requests to disabled routes are immediately given a 503 response. Both fields are lists of Route IDs, and route information (ID, version, method, path, and whether or not it can bypass to Perl) can be found by running `./traffic_ops_golang --api-routes`. To disable a route or have it bypassed to Perl, find its Route ID using the previous command and put it in the `disabled_routes` or `perl_routes` list, respectively.
- To support reusing a single riak cluster connection, an optional parameter is added to riak.conf: "HealthCheckInterval". This options takes a 'Duration' value (ie: 10s, 5m) which affects how often the riak cluster is health checked.  Default is currently set to: "HealthCheckInterval": "5s".
- Added a new Go db/admin binary to replace the Perl db/admin.pl script which is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The new db/admin binary is essentially a drop-in replacement for db/admin.pl since it supports all of the same commands and options; therefore, it should be used in place of db/admin.pl for all the same tasks.
- Added an API 1.4 endpoint, /api/1.4/cdns/dnsseckeys/refresh, to perform necessary behavior previously served outside the API under `/internal`.
- Added the DS Record text to the cdn dnsseckeys endpoint in 1.4.
- Added monitoring.json snapshotting. This stores the monitoring json in the same table as the crconfig snapshot. Snapshotting is now required in order to push out monitoring changes.
- To traffic_ops_ort.pl added the ability to handle ##OVERRIDE## delivery service ANY_MAP raw remap text to replace and comment out a base delivery service remap rules. THIS IS A TEMPORARY HACK until versioned delivery services are implemented.
- Snapshotting the CRConfig now deletes HTTPS certificates in Riak for delivery services which have been deleted in Traffic Ops.
- Added a context menu in place of the "Actions" column from the following tables in Traffic Portal: cache group tables, CDN tables, delivery service tables, parameter tables, profile tables, server tables.
- Traffic Portal standalone Dockerfile
- In Traffic Portal, removes the need to specify line breaks using `__RETURN__` in delivery service edge/mid header rewrite rules, regex remap expressions, raw remap text and traffic router additional request/response headers.
- In Traffic Portal, provides the ability to clone delivery service assignments from one cache to another cache of the same type. Issue #2963.
- Added an API 1.4 endpoint, /api/1.4/server_capabilities, to create, read, and delete server capabilities.
- Traffic Ops now allows each delivery service to have a set of query parameter keys to be retained for consistent hash generation by Traffic Router.
- In Traffic Portal, delivery service table columns can now be rearranged and their visibility toggled on/off as desired by the user. Hidden table columns are excluded from the table search. These settings are persisted in the browser.
- Added an API 1.4 endpoint, /api/1.4/user/login/oauth to handle SSO login using OAuth.
- Added /#!/sso page to Traffic Portal to catch redirects back from OAuth provider and POST token into the API.
- In Traffic Portal, server table columns can now be rearranged and their visibility toggled on/off as desired by the user. Hidden table columns are excluded from the table search. These settings are persisted in the browser.
- Added pagination support to some Traffic Ops endpoints via three new query parameters, limit and offset/page
- Traffic Ops now supports a "sortOrder" query parameter on some endpoints to return API responses in descending order
- Traffic Ops now uses a consistent format for audit logs across all Go endpoints
- Added cache-side config generator, atstccfg, installed with ORT. Includes all configs. Includes a plugin system.
- Fixed ATS config generation to omit regex remap, header rewrite, URL Sig, and URI Signing files for delivery services not assigned to that server.
- In Traffic Portal, all tables now include a 'CSV' link to enable the export of table data in CSV format.
- Pylint configuration now enforced (present in [a file in the Python client directory](./traffic_control/clients/python/pylint.rc))
- Added an optional SMTP server configuration to the TO configuration file, api now has unused abilitiy to send emails
- Traffic Monitor now has "gbps" calculated stat, allowing operators to monitor bandwidth in Gbps.
- Added an API 1.4 endpoint, /api/1.4/deliveryservices_required_capabilities, to create, read, and delete associations between a delivery service and a required capability.
- Added ATS config generation omitting parents without Delivery Service Required Capabilities.
- In Traffic Portal, added the ability to create, view and delete server capabilities and associate those server capabilities with servers and delivery services. See [blueprint](./blueprints/server-capabilitites.md)
- Added validation to prevent assigning servers to delivery services without required capabilities.
- Added deep coverage zone routing percentage to the Traffic Portal dashboard.
- Added a `traffic_ops/app/bin/osversions-convert.pl` script to convert the `osversions.cfg` file from Perl to JSON as part of the `/osversions` endpoint rewrite.
- Added [Experimental] - Emulated Vault suppling a HTTP server mimicking RIAK behavior for usage as traffic-control vault.
- Added Traffic Ops Client function that returns a Delivery Service Nullable Response when requesting for a Delivery Service by XMLID

### Changed
- Traffic Router:  TR will now allow steering DSs and steering target DSs to have RGB enabled. (fixes #3910)
- Traffic Portal:  Traffic Portal now allows Regional Geo Blocking to be enabled for a Steering Delivery Service.
- Traffic Ops: fixed a regression where the `Expires` cookie header was not being set properly in responses. Also, added the `Max-Age` cookie header in responses.
- Traffic Router, added TLS certificate validation on certificates imported from Traffic Ops
  - validates modulus of private and public keys
  - validates current timestamp falls within the certificate date bracket
  - validates certificate subjects against the DS URL
- Traffic Ops Golang Endpoints
  - Updated /api/1.1/cachegroups: Cache Group Fallbacks are included
  - Updated /api/1.1/cachegroups: fixed so fallbackToClosest can be set through API
    - Warning:  a PUT of an old Cache Group JSON without the fallbackToClosest field will result in a `null` value for that field
- Traffic Router: fixed a bug which would cause `REFUSED` DNS answers if the zone priming execution did not complete within the configured `zonemanager.init.timeout` period.
- Issue 2821: Fixed "Traffic Router may choose wrong certificate when SNI names overlap"
- traffic_ops/app/bin/checks/ToDnssecRefresh.pl now requires "user" and "pass" parameters of an operations-level user! Update your scripts accordingly! This was necessary to move to an API endpoint with proper authentication, which may be safely exposed.
- Traffic Monitor UI updated to support HTTP or HTTPS traffic.
- Traffic Monitor health/stat time now includes full body download (like prior TM <=2.1 version)
- Modified Traffic Router logging format to include an additional field for DNS log entries, namely `rhi`. This defaults to '-' and is only used when EDNS0 client subnet extensions are enabled and a client subnet is present in the request. When enabled and a subnet is present, the subnet appears in the `chi` field and the resolver address is in the `rhi` field.
- Changed traffic_ops_ort.pl so that hdr_rw-&lt;ds&gt;.config files are compared with strict ordering and line duplication when detecting configuration changes.
- Traffic Ops (golang), Traffic Monitor, Traffic Stats are now compiled using Go version 1.11. Grove was already being compiled with this version which improves performance for TLS when RSA certificates are used.
- Fixed issue #3497: TO API clients that don't specify the latest minor version will overwrite/default any fields introduced in later versions
- Fixed permissions on DELETE /api/$version/deliveryservice_server/{dsid}/{serverid} endpoint

- Issue #3646: Fixed Traffic Monitor Thresholds.
- Modified Traffic Router API to be available via HTTPS.
- Added fields to traffic_portal_properties.json to configure SSO through OAuth.
- Added field to cdn.conf to configure whitelisted URLs for Json Key Set URL returned from OAuth provider.
- Improved [profile comparison view in Traffic Portal](https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/blob/master/blueprints/profile-param-compare-manage.md).

### Deprecated/Removed
- Traffic Ops API Endpoints
  - /api/1.1/cachegroup_fallbacks
  - /api_capabilities `POST`

## [3.0.0] - 2018-10-30
### Added
- Removed MySQL-to-Postgres migration tools.  This tool is supported for 1.x to 2.x upgrades only and should not be used with 3.x.
- Backup Edge Cache group: If the matched group in the CZF is not available, this list of backup edge cache group configured via Traffic Ops API can be used as backup. In the event of all backup edge cache groups not available, GEO location can be optionally used as further backup. APIs detailed [here](http://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/traffic_ops_api/v12/cachegroup_fallbacks.html)
- Traffic Ops Golang Proxy Endpoints
  - /api/1.4/users `(GET,POST,PUT)`
  - /api/1.3/origins `(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)`
  - /api/1.3/coordinates `(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)`
  - /api/1.3/staticdnsentries `(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)`
  - /api/1.1/deliveryservices/xmlId/:xmlid/sslkeys `GET`
  - /api/1.1/deliveryservices/hostname/:hostname/sslkeys `GET`
  - /api/1.1/deliveryservices/sslkeys/add `POST`
  - /api/1.1/deliveryservices/xmlId/:xmlid/sslkeys/delete `GET`
- Delivery Service Origins Refactor: The Delivery Service API now creates/updates an Origin entity on Delivery Service creates/updates, and the `org_server_fqdn` column in the `deliveryservice` table has been removed. The `org_server_fqdn` data is now computed from the Delivery Service's primary origin (note: the name of the primary origin is the `xml_id` of its delivery service).
- Cachegroup-Coordinate Refactor: The Cachegroup API now creates/updates a Coordinate entity on Cachegroup creates/updates, and the `latitude` and `longitude` columns in the `cachegroup` table have been replaced with `coordinate` (a foreign key to Coordinate). Coordinates created from Cachegroups are given the name `from_cachegroup_\<cachegroup name\>`.
- Geolocation-based Client Steering: two new steering target types are available to use for `CLIENT_STEERING` delivery services: `STEERING_GEO_ORDER` and `STEERING_GEO_WEIGHT`. When targets of these types have an Origin with a Coordinate, Traffic Router will order and prioritize them based upon the shortest total distance from client -> edge -> origin. Co-located targets are grouped together and can be weighted or ordered within the same location using `STEERING_GEO_WEIGHT` or `STEERING_GEO_ORDER`, respectively.
- Tenancy is now the default behavior in Traffic Ops.  All database entries that reference a tenant now have a default of the root tenant.  This eliminates the need for the `use_tenancy` global parameter and will allow for code to be simplified as a result. If all user and delivery services reference the root tenant, then there will be no difference from having `use_tenancy` set to 0.
- Cachegroup Localization Methods: The Cachegroup API now supports an optional `localizationMethods` field which specifies the localization methods allowed for that cachegroup (currently 'DEEP_CZ', 'CZ', and 'GEO'). By default if this field is null/empty, all localization methods are enabled. After Traffic Router has localized a client, it will only route that client to cachegroups that have enabled the localization method used. For example, this can be used to prevent GEO-localized traffic (i.e. most likely from off-net/internet clients) to cachegroups that aren't optimal for internet traffic.
- Traffic Monitor Client Update: Traffic Monitor is updated to use the Traffic Ops v13 client.
- Removed previously deprecated `traffic_monitor_java`
- Added `infrastructure/cdn-in-a-box` for Apachecon 2018 demonstration
- The CacheURL Delivery service field is deprecated.  If you still need this functionality, you can create the configuration explicitly via the raw remap field.

## [2.2.0] - 2018-06-07
### Added
- Per-DeliveryService Routing Names: you can now choose a Delivery Service's Routing Name (rather than a hardcoded "tr" or "edge" name). This might require a few pre-upgrade steps detailed [here](http://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/traffic_ops/migration_from_20_to_22.html#per-deliveryservice-routing-names)
- [Delivery Service Requests](http://traffic-control-cdn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/quick_howto/ds_requests.html#ds-requests): When enabled, delivery service requests are created when ALL users attempt to create, update or delete a delivery service. This allows users with higher level permissions to review delivery service changes for completeness and accuracy before deploying the changes.

- Fair Queuing Pacing: Using the FQ Pacing Rate parameter in Delivery Services allows operators to limit the rate of individual sessions to the edge cache. This feature requires a Trafficserver RPM containing the fq_pacing experimental plugin AND setting 'fq' as the default Linux qdisc in sysctl.
- Traffic Ops rpm changed to remove world-read permission from configuration files.
