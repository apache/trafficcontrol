# To run the integration test:
# 1. build Traffic Monitor and then copy the RPM to this directory as traffic_monitor.rpm.
# 2. build traffic_monitor/tools/testcaches and place the binary in this directory.
# 3. build traffic_monitor/tools/testto and place the binary in this directory.
# 4. Run this compose
#
# Commands are, from the root trafficcontrol directory:
# ./pkg -v traffic_monitor_build
# cp ./dist/traffic_monitor*.rpm ./traffic_monitor/
# ./build_tests.sh
#
# To run the integration tests, your current working directory must be trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor.
# This is because Docker doesn't allow accessing files outside the current "context".
#
#      docker-compose up -d
