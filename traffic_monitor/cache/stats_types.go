// Package cache contains definitions for mechanisms used to extract health
// and statistics data from cache-server-provided data. The most commonly
// used format is the “stats_over_http” format provided by the plugin of the
// same name for Apache Traffic Server, followed closely by “astats”  which
// is the legacy format used by older versions of Apache Traffic Control.
//
// # Creating A New Stats Type
//
// To create a new Stats Type, for a custom caching proxy with its own stats
// format:
//
//  1. Create a file for your type in the traffic_monitor/cache directory and
//     package, `github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/traffic_monitor/cache/`
//  2. Create Parse and (optionally) Precompute functions in your file, with the
//     signature of `StatisticsParser` and `StatisticsPrecomputer`, respectively
//  3. In your file's special `init` func, call `registerDecoder` with your two
//     functions to register the new format. The name of the format MUST be
//     unique!
//  4. To apply the new parsing format to a cache server, set its Profile's
//     “health.polling.format“ Parameter's Value to the name of the desired
//     format.
//
// Your Parser should take the raw bytes from the `io.Reader` and populate the
// raw stats from them. It needs to provide (nearly) all of the data in a
// Statistics structure. Specifically, the available statistics MUST include:
//
//   - One-minute "loadavg" value for the cache server. The others are optional,
//     as we only use the one-minute value for health checks.
//   - At least one network interface (which will be considered the one used for
//     routing, and if multiple "monitored" network interfaces are configured for
//     the cache server in Traffic Ops they MUST all be present) and specifically
//     its name, “speed”, and bytes in and out. Parsers SHOULD return an error
//     if at least one interface cannot be found in the payload data.
//   - If your format does not directly indicate if the cache server is available
//     then NotAvailable should just be set to “false”.
//
// All other statistics (e.g. Delivery Service stats) should be returned in the
// map of statistic names to their values.
//
// Your Precomputer should take the Statistics and other miscellaneous stats
// that your Parser created, and populate the PrecomputedData. It is essential
// that all PrecomputedData fields are populated, especially
// `DeliveryServiceStats`, as they are used for cache and Delivery Service
// availability and threshold computation. If PrecomputedData is not properly
// and fully populated, the cache's availability will not be properly computed.
//
// Note the PrecomputedData `Reporting` and `Time` fields are the exception:
// they do not need to be set, and will be forcibly overridden by the Handler
// after your Precomputer function returns.
//
// Note these functions will not be called for Health polls, only Stat polls.
// Your Cache should have two separate stats endpoints: a small light endpoint
// returning only system stats and used to quickly verify reachability, and a
// large endpoint with all stats. If your cache does not have two stat
// endpoints, you may use your large stat endpoint for the Health poll, and
// configure the Health poll interval to be arbitrarily slow. These are
// controlled by the “health.polling.url' Parameter in Traffic Ops.
//
// Note your stats functions SHOULD NOT reuse functions from other stats types,
// even if they are similar, or have identical helper functions. This is a case
// where "duplicate" code is acceptable, because it's not conceptually
// duplicate. You don't want your stat parsers to break if the similar stats
// format you reuse code from changes.
