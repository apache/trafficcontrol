# NAME

t3c-generate - Traffic Control Cache Configuration generation tool

# SYNOPSIS

t3c-generate [-2bchlvVy] [-D directory] [-e location] [-i location] [-T versions] [-w location]

[\-\-help]

# DESCRIPTION

The `t3c-generate` app generates Apache Traffic Server configuration files from Traffic Ops data.

The stdin must be JSON text as output by 't3c-request --get-data=config', which contains all the data from Traffic Ops necessary to generate configuration. For the exact format, see t3c-request(1).

The output is a JSON array of objects containing the file and its metadata.
