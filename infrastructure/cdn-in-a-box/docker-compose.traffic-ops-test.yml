# This compose file runs the traffic ops integration tests assuming
# there is already a trafficops docker instance. When using docker,
# make sure any container rpms you need are updated. Below is an
# example of how to run the main compose with this file:
#
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traffic-ops-test.yml up -d edge enroller dns db smtp trafficops trafficvault integration
# docker compose -f docker-compose.traffic-ops-test.yml logs -f integration
