# This compose file runs the traffic portal integration tests assuming
# there is already a trafficportal docker instance. When using docker,
# make sure any container rpms you need are updated. Below is an
# example of how to run the main compose with this file:
# 
# docker-compose up --build db trafficops trafficops-perl trafficportal
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.traffic-portal-test.yml up --build
