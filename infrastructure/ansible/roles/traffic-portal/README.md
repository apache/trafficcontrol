Traffic_portal_v2
=========

At the primary user interface of Apache Traffic Control is the component Traffic PortaL which is installed with this role.

Requirements
------------

* A valid RPM in an available yum repository.

Role Variables
--------------

Refer to the defaults/main.yml for most information.

tpv2_version: This is an optional string that can be provided to specify a particular version of Traffic Portal to install.  It should be something like `3.0.0-10063.5db80eca.el7`.  The absence of this variable entails automatically using the latest version available to yum at the time of initial installation.

tpv2_properties_template: An optional dictionary to merge into/atop the default traffic_portal_properties.json file

additional_yum_repos: An optional list of additional yum repositories to enable specifically when installing this component.  This could be used to enable non-production ready rpms in a separate repository and not supplying the specific RPM version to automatically use the latest available.

Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------
```yaml
  - name: Deploy Traffic Portal V2
